// ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's window, never the standard one's.
//
// Codex Auto Resume - keep going on the Advanced features page (v0.6.15-beta).
//
// While keep_going is on, its column has a card under its limits: each conversation kept going, a flat line saying how
// many continuations it has had of how many it may have now, with Stop under it; then the form one is picked with - the
// conversation and how many continuations, 1 to 10 - and Keep it going..., which asks first. Until MK is measured on the
// Codex in force no more than three are sent, which the card says. Each request is the bridge's (advanced-keep-going,
// advanced-keep-going-set, advanced-keep-going-stop), with the generation the list was read at, and the card is read
// again after each.
//
// Nothing here draws anything the page does not draw already: the cards, captions, help lines, rows, drop-downs and
// buttons are the Settings page's.
//
// C# 5 (the in-box compiler), as the rest of the window.
