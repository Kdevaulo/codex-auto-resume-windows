// ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's window, never the standard one's.
//
// Codex Auto Resume - the Advanced features page's Keep it on and Send now (v0.6.14, stage 3b).
//
// Keep it on (the owner's K8): for the open capability while it is on or watched, a card under its limits that says
// whether it turns itself off when something it relies on goes wrong, and what it noted instead where it is kept on - and
// three buttons, each shown where it can act: Keep it on..., Also send again when unsure... (with Keep on, never for a
// capability that resends itself, nor for an action, which sends no continuation) and Let it turn itself off. Each
// turn-on asks first in the window's own dialog, with its warning, the safe answer the default (AskAdvanced), and sends
// exactly what that warning was, confirmed in its words (advanced-keep-on); letting go asks nothing, as turning off never
// does. What a kept-on capability noted is a line in the accent under its state on its first card (KeptText), beside what
// turned one off (TrippedText); turning it on again is how the person confirms again.
//
// Send now: while Send now is on - not watched: the bridge refuses a request it could only journal - a card of the
// recoveries waiting now, flat lines from the pending list the window already holds (SnapshotApplied), each with its own
// Send now... under it, as each rule has its Remove; pressing one asks first, and sends that record's interruption id
// (advanced-send-now). The watcher sends it at its next look, if every check passes; the list then shows what happened.
//
// Nothing here draws anything the page does not draw already: the cards, captions, help lines and buttons are the
// Settings page's, and the lines in the accent are the page's own.
//
// C# 5 (the in-box compiler), as the rest of the window.
