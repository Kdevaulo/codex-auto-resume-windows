// ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's window, never the standard one's.
//
// Codex Auto Resume - the advanced edition's own page of the Dashboard: Advanced features.
//
// Every capability of this edition starts off, and stays off until a person turns it on - or has it
// watched first - one at a time, here and nowhere else, after reading its statement (the owner's rules of
// 2026-09-26). The bridge refuses every other actor (advanced/src/codex_auto_resume_advanced/arming.py);
// this page is the Dashboard that rule names. It lists every capability in the order advanced-list answers
// (registry.SHOWN_ORDER, the owner's of 2026-10-10: the compatibility report first), one flat row each - its
// name and its state in the registry's words - and the one that is open shows its statement
// in the person's language, what an administrator's Windows policy refuses of it, the warnings its statement
// carries now, and its limits, with the one limit a person may set: lower, and never above the registry's. Under its
// limits (v0.6.14), where it has them: its own choices, one drop-down each (advanced-option); the rules a person writes
// for Codex's error codes, each with what it did in 30 days, removed or added here (advanced-rules, advanced-rule-add,
// advanced-rule-remove); and the samples of failures nothing classified, codes and numbers only (advanced-samples).
// Each is written against the generation the page read, and a refusal is told in words. And (v0.6.14) a Keep it on
// card for one that is on or watched, and Send now's waiting recoveries (advanced/gui/AdvancedKeepOn.cs); and last,
// what one watched would have done, counted (advanced-watch-log, advanced/gui/AdvancedWatch.cs).
//
// Its place is after Settings, the last tab. The Dashboard's pages are gui/Dashboard.cs's PageOrder, and the
// window's navigation is that one strip of tabs: nothing in it is a place for an edition's page, and a Settings
// section would not do - the Settings page is saved with its Save button and is never read again under a person
// editing it, where this page acts at once and follows every read. A tab after the last moves none of the
// standard ones: the six keep the places they have in the standard window, and Ctrl+Tab goes on from Settings to
// this page and back to the Overview (ProcessCmdKey). The tab shows once this edition has answered with its
// words, which are its own catalogs' and not core's (the bridge's advanced-words); an installation whose
// advanced package could not be loaded answers nothing, and shows no page it could not act on.
//
// The page is built as Pending is, from the same parts: the list on its card, flat rows with a hairline between
// them and the state in its chip; beside it, the open capability's cards in a column that scrolls, as the
// Settings page's sections stand beside their list, made of the Settings page's cards, captions, help lines and
// rows, with what a policy refuses in the accent as Diagnostics says what needs noticing; and under both, the row
// of buttons that act on the chosen row, with what the last action did beside them. The window's own dialog asks.
// Nothing here draws anything the standard window does not draw.
//
// Turning a capability on, or watching it, asks first, in the window's own dialog, with the statement and every
// warning it carries (ArmQuestion); the safe answer is the default, so only the button that names the action says
// yes. What is sent is exactly what was shown - the generation the page read the list at, the statement's
// revision, its warnings and the Codex version it named (ArmArgument) - and when the bridge answers that something
// changed since, the page reads the list and the statement again and asks again, with what holds now - or, where what
// holds now cannot be asked for (it could not be read again, or an administrator's policy now refuses it), tells the
// person who said yes why nothing was turned on (ArmHeld). Turning off asks nothing: it only ever does less.
//
// A capability that is an action - the compatibility report - has a card of its own under its statement
// (advanced/gui/AdvancedReport.cs), and its limits say it sends nothing to Codex.
//
// advanced/gui/AdvancedPageAudit.cs is this page's audit, and the hooks its tests drive it through.
//
// C# 5 (the in-box compiler), as the rest of the window.
