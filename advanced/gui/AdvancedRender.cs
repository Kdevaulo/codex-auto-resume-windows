// ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's window, never the standard one's.
//
// Codex Auto Resume - the Advanced features page in the render mode (gui/WindowRender.cs), for the pictures of the
// advanced edition (build/advanced_shots.py).
//
// The render mode puts the window in each frame's state as far as the standard window goes - a page, a section, a
// scroll, a face - and hands the frame here (RenderStateNamed, a point gui/Dashboard.cs declares). A frame on this page
// shows it once this edition has answered with its words; opens the capability it names, waiting until its statement
// and what it keeps have been read and shown; for the compatibility report, writes the report and checks what sending
// would write, each from the job's replies, as a person's clicks would; and scrolls the open capability's column, to a
// part the frame names or by turns of the wheel. Each
// is waited for until it is drawn. A capability this tree does not have, a statement that was not read, or a report
// that was not written stops the job: a picture is never of something else.
//
// Nothing here runs in a window a person opens: only the render mode calls the point, beside a capture's event.
//
// C# 5 (the in-box compiler), as the rest of the window.
