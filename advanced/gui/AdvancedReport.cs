// ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's window, never the standard one's.
//
// Codex Auto Resume - the compatibility report's card on the Advanced features page (advanced/gui/AdvancedPage.cs).
//
// A capability that is an action (the bridge's listing says `kind`) answers at no point and sends nothing to Codex:
// what it does, a person starts here. Its card follows its statement while it is watched or on - write the report
// from this PC's own records, read the whole file with its SHA-256, save it where the person chooses - and, only while
// it is on, ask GitHub through gh what sending would write, show every write, and send once the person has typed the
// word send in its box, exactly. While it is off, the card's controls go and the last check's or send's ending stays.
// The page names no capability: it acts on the open one, by what the listing says it is.
//
// Writing, checking and sending are jobs of the Dashboard's service (report/flow.py): a start answers with the job's
// id at once, and the page reads the job once a second, as a read, until it ends. Each start is an action - every
// other action waits until it is answered - and no longer: Turn off stays live while a send runs. A check or a send
// holds the window's reopen until it ends (HoldReopen, the neutral counter beside `busy`), because the service that
// runs it ends with the window. A send whose start is answered with no job and no refusal of its own - the one-shot
// bridge's "unknown command", a failure - and a job the service no longer holds are both shown as lost, with the way
// to tell what is on GitHub: check again. Nothing here starts a process, opens a browser or touches the clipboard: the
// link, the branch and the file's name are text the person can select.
//
// C# 5 (the in-box compiler), as the rest of the window.
