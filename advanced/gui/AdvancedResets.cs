// ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's window, never the standard one's.
//
// Codex Auto Resume - the reset actions on the Advanced features page, and Pending's scheduled ones (v0.6.14).
//
// Two capabilities act at a usage reset a person picks: a reset credit used when the limit they pick is reached
// (reset_credit), and a message of their own sent to a conversation when the window they pick resets (reset_message).
// While one is on, its column has a card under its limits: its rules, each a flat line saying what it waits for and
// where its count stands, with Cancel under it - Go on counting for one held over a gap, and Use a reset credit now
// for a credit due that waits for a click - then the form a rule is added with: the window (the 5-hour limit, the
// weekly one, and any other Codex reports) and which of its next resets or fills, from the next one to 9 from now -
// only the next for the weekly one; for a credit, how often and whether it asks first; for a message, the conversation
// and the words, counted to the bound. Add asks first, with what it will do. Each request is the bridge's
// (advanced-resets, advanced-reset-add, advanced-reset-cancel, advanced-reset-go-on, advanced-credit-now), with the
// generation the list was read at, and the card is read again after each. What is being written is kept while the
// card is built again, and the keyboard goes back to where it was.
//
// On Pending (PendingBuilt), a group under the list, shown only while something is scheduled: one flat line for each
// rule still to act, with Cancel - and Go on counting for one held over a gap - so a message waiting for a reset is seen
// beside the recoveries waiting for theirs.
// It is read when the status's counts of them change (surfaces.status).
//
// Nothing here draws anything the page does not draw already: the cards, captions, help lines, rows, drop-downs, text
// box and buttons are the Settings page's.
//
// C# 5 (the in-box compiler), as the rest of the window.
