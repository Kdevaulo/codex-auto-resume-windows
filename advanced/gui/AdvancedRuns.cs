// ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's window, never the standard one's.
//
// Codex Auto Resume - the turns run here, on the Advanced features page (v0.6.16-beta.4).
//
// While Run a conversation here while Codex is closed, Compact a full conversation or the model fallback is on or
// watched, its column has a card under its limits: each turn that capability runs here now, a flat line saying for
// which conversation and until when at most, with Stop... under it. Pressing one asks first, and hands the watcher that
// run's Stop (advanced-headless-stop) - the Dashboard's alone, never an MCP tool's; the turn is interrupted at the
// watcher's next look. A Stop already asked reads "Stopping..." until the run ends. The runs are the ones the status the
// window already reads carries (surfaces.runs), never a word of a conversation.
//
// Nothing here draws anything the page does not draw already: the card, the help lines and the buttons are Send now's.
//
// And what Pending and History say of a row this edition had a hand in (CellsWritten): words joined to a cell's own
// line - " · CLI" or " · VS Code" after the conversation of a terminal's or VS Code's (other_sessions), and "Run
// /compact in Codex; it continues after" after the status of a full conversation waiting for it (compact_continue) - from what the
// status the window already reads carries of each row, by its interruption id (surfaces.rows). No cell, column or
// element of its own: as a second Codex home's alias joins the label line (v0.6.15-beta).
//
// C# 5 (the in-box compiler), as the rest of the window.
