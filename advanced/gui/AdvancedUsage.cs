// ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's window, never the standard one's.
//
// Codex Auto Resume - the Advanced features page's near-the-limit choices (v0.6.16-beta.4, the owner's additions to
// issue #29).
//
// Wrap up near a limit's words as they would be sent: under its drop-downs, for each window, the exact words the wrap-up
// would send now - its wording, numbers, reset time and Custom words as they stand, in the continuation language - as
// the continuation styles show theirs (the bridge makes them: advanced-wordings' `previews`).
//
// Wrap up near a limit's Custom wording: while its Wording is Custom, its Choices card has, under the drop-downs, one
// box for each window - the five-hour and the weekly - with the person's own words (advanced-wordings, read when the
// capability opens), a line saying which numbers the words may hold, and Save words under each (advanced-wording, with
// the generation the page read). A refusal says why, in the page's words for each of the custom text's checks. The words
// are the person's own and are never written anywhere but the advanced state.
//
// Every number with Custom... (item (f), "이런 수치들은 직접 입력도 가능해야 한다니까"): a choice the bridge says takes a number
// of one's own (its `custom` range) has Custom... last in its drop-down, and a number already taken shown there as itself,
// one item before Custom.... Custom... opens the small dialog the Settings page's Custom... has opened since v0.6.11
// (SettingsOwn.cs OwnDialog; v0.6.16 final, the owner's "예전에 직접입력 누를 시 하던 방식대로"): the range said above a
// number, in the unit the choices are said in, Use this value and Cancel. A number outside the range is refused in the
// dialog, with the range, and nothing is sent; Cancel puts the drop-down back on the item it held; a number taken shows
// in the drop-down - as one item before Custom..., or as the preset it is - and is sent as a choice is, the bridge's
// refusal said as the page says any.
//
// Both windows off (v0.6.16 final): a capability with a pair of window switches - the meter, the wrap-up, the stop - and
// both of them off says, under them, that it acts on neither.
//
// Nothing here draws anything the page does not draw already: the captions, help lines, boxes and buttons are the
// Settings page's.
//
// C# 5 (the in-box compiler), as the rest of the window.
