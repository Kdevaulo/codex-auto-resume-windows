// ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's window, never the standard one's.
//
// Codex Auto Resume - the Advanced features page's watch log (v0.6.14): what the open capability would have done while
// it was watched.
//
// While a capability is watched ("Watch first") it is asked wherever it would act, and none of its answers is taken: each
// is counted instead, once for each recovery and answer (advanced/src/codex_auto_resume_advanced/watchlog.py). This is
// where a person reads that count: a card, last in the open capability's column after its samples, so it moves none of
// the cards above it - its title; since when it is watched, where it is; one line for each answer, as each sample is a
// line - the answer in words, how many times and the last minute; that it has been asked nothing yet, where it is watched
// with nothing counted; from when it counts, where the bound let older answers go; and that watching does nothing. It
// shows only where the bridge's advanced-watch-log answered and the capability is watched or has answers counted in the
// 30 days; never for an action, which is never asked anything, so its log would always be empty.
//
// The page reads it after the rules and the samples (ReadAdvancedKept), and again at every read, so the card keeps up with
// each snapshot as the rest of the page does, with no timer of its own. Times are the window's own (When), so a picture
// with a pinned clock prints the same ones.
//
// Nothing here draws anything the page does not draw already: the card, its caption and its lines are the Settings
// page's, and each answer's line is styled as a sample's is.
//
// C# 5 (the in-box compiler), as the rest of the window.
