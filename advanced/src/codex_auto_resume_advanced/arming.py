"""Who may turn a capability on, who may turn it off, and what turns it off by itself.

Every capability starts off, and stays off until a person turns it on, one at a time, in the
Dashboard, after its statement. So `arm` - which also moves one to "Watch first" - takes an actor
and refuses every actor but the Dashboard, and it needs what only the Dashboard has just shown
the person, each of which must still hold when the request arrives:

* the statement revision they read;
* the generation the Dashboard read the list at, so that anything turned off anywhere since - by
  a person, a tripwire or a policy - is never undone by a window that had not seen it yet;
* the statement's warnings (`warnings_for`), exactly as they hold now: a measurement its route
  rests on that failed or was never made for this Codex, a compatibility grade of FAILED_HERE,
  INCOMPATIBLE or UNKNOWN, no Codex version known. A warning never refuses. Turning the
  capability on, or watching it, is the person's confirmation of every warning shown, and the
  set they confirmed is stored with the state;
* for "on", the Codex version the Dashboard showed, which is the one in force - or none, where
  none is known, which is itself a warning.

That replaced decision C7 (the owner, 2026-09-26). A failed measurement or a low grade used to be
a refusal - compat.permits at the experimental tier - and is now a warning the person confirms.
What still refuses a capability is an administrator's policy (policy.py): ForbidAdvanced,
AllowedCapabilities, and ForceShadow for "on". Every other refusal says only that the request
was not the person's own, current confirmation, which the Dashboard can ask for again at once.

Turning off is the other way round. `disarm` and `all_off` take any actor that is a surface -
the Dashboard, MCP, the icon, a card - and need nothing: turning something off only ever does
less, like a Pause. MCP can turn things off and nothing else (surfaces.py).

Shadow ("Watch first") never promotes itself: nothing here, or anywhere, moves a capability
from watched to on except a person arming it.

What a capability is at this moment (`standing`) is its stored state as seen through what has
happened since, and a few of those things are carried out, because each means the person's
agreement no longer covers what the capability would do:

* the tripwires turn it off: its statement changed (a new revision the person has not read); a
  warning they did not confirm appeared that says what it stands on went wrong - its
  compatibility FAILED_HERE or INCOMPATIBLE here, or a measurement its route rests on failed; a
  hook of its raised; or a send it paid for became submission_unknown - that send, claimed when
  it paid, and not a later one core made of the same record alone. A warning they confirmed never
  trips it: it was so when they turned it on;
* a new Codex version turns an armed capability off: the acknowledgement was for another one;
* a policy (policy.py) only reads it down - off, or watched - and changes nothing stored; so,
  for one that is on, does a compatibility or a Codex version that cannot be read now, where the
  person did not confirm that.

Re-arming is always possible: whatever turned a capability off - a person, a tripwire, a new
Codex - the Dashboard can turn it on again, with its statement as it reads then.

Keep on (v0.6.14, the owner's K8, amending K7): a person may keep a capability that is on or watched
from turning itself off, in the Dashboard, after its warning. Kept on, each tripwire and a new Codex
version are noted instead, the most serious kept until the person arms it again; a hook that raises
costs only the record it raised for (runtime.py); what cannot be read still holds it back (E1); and the
policy reads it down first, so the administrator wins. Any move to off - the person's, from any
surface - takes it away.

Send again (v0.6.14), only with Keep on: a continuation the kept-on capability paid for that cannot be
proven to have arrived is sent once more, under the once-more capability's rules (`resender`), and only
where the policy admits that capability as well - Send again does what it does, so it departs from what
it departs from too (`departs`). A continuation sent once more and then found twice turns off what sent
it again (`sweep`): the once-more capability itself, whether or not it is kept on, or Send again alone,
the capability staying on with that noted.
