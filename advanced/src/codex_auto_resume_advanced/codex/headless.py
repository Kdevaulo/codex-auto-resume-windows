# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""One turn of a conversation nothing holds, run here on our own app server, every approval declined (v0.6.16-beta.4).

The standard edition waits for the Codex app to hold a conversation before anything is sent there (A11), and only
through `codex queue` (A2). A route of this module (`HeadlessRun`) is what core calls instead, at P16, for a record
whose conversation nothing holds while Codex is closed: core has made its one claim, its pre-send look and its launch
guard, and decided the words (core's engine/dispatch.py) - this starts the one turn they ask for, and nothing else.

`resume`, inside the guard core entered:

1. a session of our own, `codex app-server --stdio`, under the asking capability's own methods
   (protocol.CAPABILITY_METHODS) - headless_run's cannot compact or change a model;
2. thread/resume with no override at all: the model, sandbox, approvals and folder Codex saved for the thread apply;
3. those settings read from the answer as closed words, against an allow-list - a readOnly or workspaceWrite sandbox,
   approvals that go to the person (`user`), an approval policy that is a word, no permission profile or only Codex's
   built-in workspace or read-only one (PROFILES) -
   and anything else (full access, an outside sandbox, another reviewer, a word this does not know) refused before
   anything starts (Q4: `refused_settings`);
4. core's look at whether the conversation is still unheld and the app still closed, asked again - the writer lock
   our own server took at thread/resume counted as no other holder (core's pairing.own_server, by the pid and
   creation time of the spawn), any other holder still a no;
5. turn/start with core's words (or none, SILENT) under the client id core derived - or, in compact mode,
   thread/compact/start; a refusal Codex answered is "not started", no answer is "unknown" (A6);
6. "ran" (or "accepted" for a compaction) with the turn's id, and the open session handed to the follower. A
   fallback turn's model is stored as owed back before its turn/start, and put back here on every path that does
   not hand the session over.

The follower - one daemon thread, at most one run in the whole process - follows that one turn to its end and never
starts another: it answers every request Codex makes with that request's refusal (protocol.reply_to), interrupts the
turn at its cap (the person's Hours), at a person's Stop and at once when the Codex app starts (Q3, until a
measurement says what the app does then), puts back a model it changed (fallback mode), always unsubscribes and
closes the process (ended after four seconds only if it hangs). It writes nothing: the end it came to is one closed
word on an in-memory queue, which the capability's P8 tick takes and journals (engine/headless.py). The watcher
leaving interrupts and lets go first (`stop_all`, at exit).
