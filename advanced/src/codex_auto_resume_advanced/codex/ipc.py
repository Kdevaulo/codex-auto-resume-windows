# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""The Codex Desktop app's own IPC pipe, \\\\.\\pipe\\codex-ipc - for the forced stop near a usage limit alone
(v0.6.16-beta.4, usage_pause; measurement MIPC passed on codex-cli 0.162.0-alpha.17.2 with app 26.1007.9446.0, and
again on 0.163.0-alpha.10.2 with app 26.1013.3656.0 - f16c9ca2 on measure-20261017 - where v4 was measured too).

What it does, and nothing else: open the pipe, `initialize`, ask `thread-owner-discovery` which client of the app
holds the conversation, and ask that client `thread-follower-interrupt-turn` (mode "system") for it - the stop a
person makes with the app's own Stop button. The app then pauses that conversation's queue, a pause that survives
its restart. And, after the window resets, `thread-follower-start-turn` - a turn started with the product's own
continuation, which goes past that paused queue - for a conversation it stopped (start_turn); measured 2026-10-16,
once that turn completes the app sends what was queued by itself and the pause is gone, so nothing else is asked of
the queue (`thread-follower-set-queued-follow-ups-state` is not needed). Every frame is 4 bytes of little-endian
length and UTF-8 JSON. Each request has one deadline for its whole answer, READ_SECONDS from when it is written,
however many broadcasts come first (an overlapped read, cancelled and waited out, then the pipe closed - as the MIPC
look does); nothing here waits for good.

The app checks each request's version exactly, and a new app build may move one: the versions are pinned in
REQUESTS, every request's shape is there too, and a version mismatch is an answer like any other failure - the
caller falls back (holds this product's continuations until the reset, and tells the person the turn could not be
stopped). Every outcome is one closed word (Stop). Never a conversation's words, never an id in a log: the caller
journals the word alone.
