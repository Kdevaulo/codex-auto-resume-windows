# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""Which App Server methods each measurement may call, and the one-turn session that calls them.

Core's finite helper (codex/appserver.py) may call three methods and no others, and
tests/test_privacy_claims.py holds it to that list. A measurement needs more - to read the
loaded threads, set a goal, add a queue item, resume a thread for one headless turn - so those
method names are here, in the advanced package, and never in core. `MEASUREMENT_METHODS` says
which measurement may call which, and a session opened for a measurement refuses every method
that measurement did not declare, even one another measurement is allowed. `ADVANCED_METHODS`
is their union, the whole of what this edition may ever ask beyond core's three.

`Session` is the helper the design calls SessionProtocol: opened for one turn against a Codex
whose thread no process is holding, it follows that turn's notifications, answers every request
Codex makes of it - approvals, elicitations, input - with that request's own refusal from Codex's
schema (`DECLINE_ANSWERS`), never an accepting one, answers the requests that touch
authentication or attestation with an error and never with what they ask, refuses to call those
methods whatever the allow-list says, and always ends with `thread/unsubscribe`. It is a thin
client over `codex app-server --stdio`; the harness drives it through an injected factory, so
the tests use a fake and no test opens a real Codex.
Its own correctness against a live engine is what the owner proves by running the measurements
(that is what M6 records) - the alpha exists for exactly that.
