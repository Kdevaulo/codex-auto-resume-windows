# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""Codex's turn history, read-only (v0.6.15-beta): what kinds of item a conversation's latest turn left, which
conversations finished a turn lately, and the statuses of a plan's steps - never what any of it says.

The empty-response recovery (engine/emptyreply.py) and keep going (engine/keepgoing.py) judge a turn by the kinds of
item it left alone, counted per `item_type` (no content column); keep going stops on a finished plan, read by
`plan_statuses`, whose one statement selects only `json_extract(step.value, '$.status')` over the newest plan
item's steps - never a step's words. Every statement this module runs is one of `STATEMENTS` below, which
advanced/tests/test_advanced_codex_reads.py holds to that.

v0.6.16-beta.3: a conversation Codex split (issue #30) is read as core reads it - every id its turns are recorded
under, in order, from core's own `turn_chain` (codex/history.py), and a later id's turn after every earlier id's
(codex/rollout.SPAN) - and a split id that finished a turn lately is named as its conversation (`owner_of`).

The file is found as core finds every Codex database (codex/paths.newest_generation): the newest generation, a
symbolic link never followed, the columns read required, opened read-only with query_only on and trusted_schema off
(B1). Anything that goes wrong is TurnsUnavailable, which every capability reads as "do nothing".
