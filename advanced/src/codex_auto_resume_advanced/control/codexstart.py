# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""Start-with-Codex through WMI: the advanced edition's route at P9.

Codex runs each plugin's MCP server inside a job object with KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE and no breakaway
(measured, MW), so a watcher the server starts plainly dies when Codex cancels the server, a few
seconds later. Core refuses to start one there (control/codexstart.py). This capability is the
one way out that was measured to work: a process inside such a job asks WMI Win32_Process.Create
to start the watcher, whose parent becomes WmiPrvSE - outside the job - so closing the job does
not end it. It is decision C9's route, and it departs from C4 ("nothing at start") and F6 (a
process-creation route beyond the listed ones), which is why it is advanced and off until armed.

What is here is the route alone. Core reaches P9 only after every existing refusal, and only
where the job would end the watcher; it asks this capability for a route, builds the command
line itself - from the windowless interpreter and this installation's stable launcher, the same
two pieces `_launch_watcher` uses - and calls `start` with it, once, under the install lock it
re-checks. This code never builds that command line, never sends, never claims, and touches no
setting: it runs one constant PowerShell script through core's `pwsh` (values in environment
variables, PowerShell by its System32 path) that calls Win32_Process.Create with ShowWindow = 0,
and reads back the created watcher's pid. Every process in the chain is windowless: `pwsh` runs
under CREATE_NO_WINDOW, the create carries ShowWindow = 0, and the launcher is pythonw.exe.

The live proof - that the created watcher shows the same pid, stands outside any job and is at
Medium integrity after Codex closes - is measurement MW (measure.py), which the owner runs by
hand on a real machine. Nothing here runs in a test: the tests give the capability a fake `pwsh`
runner, so no test starts a real process or reaches WMI.

# created process windowless (the console rules); CreateFlags is never passed, because WMI returns
# 21 when it is. A missing or non-zero ReturnValue becomes a distinct non-zero exit, so the caller
# learns the create failed, and its code, without any output being read.
