# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""The Dashboard's keep going (v0.6.15-beta): the conversations kept going read, one picked with a count, one stopped.

Each is the long-lived bridge's, the Dashboard's alone (surfaces.py), against the generation the page read: a page
that had not seen something turned off is refused, as an arm is. No MCP tool reaches any of them. A conversation is
picked only while keep_going stands on and the conversation is switched on, with a count of 1 to 10 - of which no
more than engine/keepgoing.UNMEASURED_COUNT are sent until MK passes on the Codex in force (`count_capped`).
