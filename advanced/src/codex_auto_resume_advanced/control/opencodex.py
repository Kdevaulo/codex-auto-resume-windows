# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""Open Codex on a notice (v0.6.18): a button that shows a notice's conversation in the Codex app.

The standard edition's notices offer two kinds of button and no others (A28): one that cancels one exact
interruption, and one that opens one page of the Dashboard. With this capability on, a notice about one
conversation - its key that conversation's id (notifier.Notice.key) - offers a third beside them, Open Codex,
whose link is the Codex app's own link to that conversation (core's notify.codex_thread_uri, measured on Codex
app 26.1007: a running, minimized or closed app opens at that conversation). The card opens it through
notify.open_in_codex (core's notifier.activate already reads exactly that link, and nothing else of its shape);
Windows' own toast hands it to whatever is registered for `codex:`. The link only shows a conversation: nothing
is sent, nothing is changed, and the card still has no send path (A1).

An action: core never asks it anything. While it stands on and Windows has a handler for `codex:` - read, never
written, from the registry's Software\\Classes\\codex under HKEY_CURRENT_USER, then HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, a key
marked "URL Protocol" as every registered URL scheme is - the icon's surface says so (surfaces.notice_view), and
the watcher adds the button to each notice it builds about one conversation (core's notifier.with_open_codex).
Where Windows has none, the button is not offered: a link nothing can open is not shown.
