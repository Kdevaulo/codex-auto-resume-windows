# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""The Dashboard's prompt queue (v0.6.14-beta.2): the queued prompts read, one added, one cancelled, one held let go on.

Each is the long-lived bridge's, the Dashboard's alone (surfaces.py), against the generation the page read. No MCP
tool reaches any of them. A prompt is added only while prompt_queue stands on and its conversation is switched on,
checked as core checks a message of a person's (continuation.validate_prompt: no empty text, no marker, no shipped
template), at most 2,000 characters unless Longer messages stands on; twenty waiting in all and five to a
conversation (state/prompts.py). Cancel takes the words at once - or, for one Codex already holds in its queue, asks
core to take it back out (the owner's answer of 2026-10-09), which says on its row when Codex will not; one being
sent, Cancel no longer reaches.
