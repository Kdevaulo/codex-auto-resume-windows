# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""The Dashboard's reset actions (v0.6.14): their rules read, one added, one cancelled, one held over a gap let
go on, and a reset credit used now.

Each is the long-lived bridge's, the Dashboard's alone (surfaces.py), against the generation the page read: a page
that had not seen something turned off is refused, as an arm is. No MCP tool reaches any of them, and core's own
update_settings has no field they could be written through.

A rule is added only while its capability stands on - watched, a rule could neither be adopted nor counted (its
errand is not run, runtime.py) - and every rule of a capability that stands anywhere else is cancelled at the next
sweep, its words with it (arming.py). A message is for one conversation, ten in all and one to a conversation, at
most 2,000 characters - A27's bound - unless Longer reset messages stands on, and then what one continuation can
carry (continuation.PROMPT_LIMIT); it is checked as core checks it before it is sent (validate_prompt). Use a reset
credit now is a person's click: a rule of its own, good for fifteen minutes, which the errand spends at its next
look - with every check of its own but Ask me first - and the watcher is woken for it, as Send now wakes it.
