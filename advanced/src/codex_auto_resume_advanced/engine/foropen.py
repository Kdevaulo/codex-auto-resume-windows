# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""Queue for opening: a conversation the Codex app does not hold is sent core's ordinary continuation, left in Codex's
queue for when the person opens it, for the days they chose (v0.6.15-beta, P16's QUEUE_FOR_OPEN).

The standard edition waits for the app to hold a conversation before it sends anything there (A11: nothing is queued
on the off chance). With this on, P16 answers QUEUE_FOR_OPEN for a usage-limited conversation the app does not hold
(core asks only where it reads notLoaded, never unknown, after consent): core sends its own words, with its marker,
through its own backend, under the one claim - which writes this capability's QUEUE_FOR_OPEN override, one per
interruption (ledger.py) - and Codex delivers it when the conversation is opened (M1). In the watch core asks again
whether to keep it there: yes while the override is within the person's Days (3 to 7, 3 by default), no after - and
core takes it back at seven days and an hour whatever is answered (core's engine/foropen.py). An interruption once
queued for opening is never queued for opening again: given back to waiting, it waits for the app as A11 says.

Opened and not delivered within core's 180 seconds, core takes it back (not_delivered_on_open), gives it back to
waiting and sends it the ordinary way to the now loaded conversation - and this capability turns off: the tripwire
NOT_DELIVERED_ON_OPEN (runtime.moved). Where the goal continuation's route applies it answers first, before this in
the registry, and its route is carried out.

Beside the goal continuation (v0.6.17, #47 P-4). Once that route has set a conversation's goal active, its P16 answers
nothing more, and core asks no P3 for a record queued for opening - so the goal continuation's hold, "the goal and the
standard continuation never both run", would never be asked, and opening the conversation could run two turns: the
goal carried on (M2) and the queued continuation (M1). Measurement MQG asks Codex exactly that. Where it passed on the
Codex in force - one turn: the queued message ran and the goal carried on after it - both apply and nothing is held.
Anywhere else - not measured on this Codex, or measured as two turns - this answers nothing for a conversation whose
goal is active while the goal continuation is on: the goal carries the conversation, one continuation, and the record
waits for the app as A11 says. Its journal says so once a record, `qfo.goal_unmeasured` or `qfo.goal_two_turns`. The
goal is read as the goal continuation reads it (codex/goals.py: its status, never its words); one that cannot be read
is no goal, as there. An active goal also stands for the goal continuation's claim: its route is accepted only once the
goal reads back active.

It holds no memory of its own: what it reads is the state's, through its view (state.Scoped).
