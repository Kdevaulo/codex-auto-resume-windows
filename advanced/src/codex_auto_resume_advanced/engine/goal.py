# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""Goal continuation: the advanced edition's answer at P16, P3 and P5.

Codex pauses a conversation's goal when a usage limit stops it (status usage_limited) and does
not resume it after the reset. The standard edition never touches a goal (standard 0.5): it waits
until the app has the conversation open (A11) and queues its continuation through `codex queue`
(A2). With this capability on, and only for an interruption that is a usage limit:

* P16 - a conversation the app does not hold. Where core would wait for the app to open it and
  the conversation's goal is paused by the usage limit, this names itself as the route. Core then
  runs every gate a send passes, claims the record - this capability paying one unit there, before
  anything is asked of Codex - makes its pre-send look, and calls `resume` once inside the launch
  guard. `resume` sets that existing goal active through Codex's own app server - thread/goal/set
  with the thread and the status alone: never a goal created, never its words touched - and reads
  it back. Measurement M2 found a goal set so is not seen while the app holds the conversation
  and is live once the app loads it again, so this is where it is set: when the app next opens the
  conversation Codex carries the goal on, and that turn supersedes the record by core's own rule.
  The app may open the conversation while the session starts, so the set is made only once core's
  own look, asked again after the session is up, still finds it not held; where it does not, the
  goal is left as it was and the answer is "not started", so core gives its claim back and the
  standard continuation follows once the app holds the conversation. The app can still open it
  between that look and the set; so the look is asked once more after the goal reads back active,
  and where the app holds the conversation then the answer is unknown (v0.6.18): never accepted on
  a set the app may not see, never a second send.
* P3 - thread_available, once the app holds the conversation. While its goal is active - Codex's
  own goal runtime is carrying the conversation on - the standard continuation is held back, for
  at most HOLD_SECONDS from the first time it was found so, so the two never both run.
* P5 - a conversation the app holds, whose goal is paused by the usage limit, and only where
  measurement M2b's recorded verdict is a pass for the Codex in force (a goal set active and a turn
  queued while the app holds the conversation: the turn runs, and the goal stays active and
  carries on). There this is the channel: it sets the goal active and then adds the continuation
  to the conversation's queue, in that order, as M2b did. Anywhere else it answers nothing, and
  core sends through `codex queue`, as the standard edition does.

What this code does not do is decide: every gate, the claim, the pre-send look and the launch
guard are core's, and so is what follows. The goal is read from Codex's goals database - which
goal, its status, when it changed (codex/goals.py) - and its words are never read, stored or
logged. A goal that cannot be read is no goal: the answer is the standard edition's.

No test opens a real Codex: the tests give it a goals database of their own and a session over a
fake app server, and a live session is opened only by a watcher that has this capability armed.
