# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""Marker-free continuation: the advanced edition's answer at P5 and P15.

The standard edition sends every continuation with `codex queue` and ends its words with a short
marker, `[codex-auto-resume:<16 hex>]`, which is how it proves the message arrived and finds the
turn it started (A2, A4). This capability sends the words with no marker. Asked at P15 it answers
CLIENT_ID, and asked at P5 it names itself as the channel; core then derives a client id from the
interruption (ids.continuation_client_id - the same interruption, the same id), writes it into the
record before the claim, and hands this channel the words and that id for the one send. The
channel adds one item to the conversation's queue through Codex's own app server -
`thread/queue/add` with `clientUserMessageId`, the call measurement M7 made - and Codex keeps the
id on the message as `clientId`. That call changes Codex's state through its app server, which the
standard edition never asks it to (B3, B4), so the statement names those two standards as well
as A2 and A4. Core proves delivery by that id and by nothing else
(engine/delivery.py in core), and follows, takes back and settles the record by it exactly as it
does one with a marker.

What this code does not do is decide anything: every gate, the claim, the pre-send look and the
launch guard are core's, and so is what follows the send. Where the send cannot be proven - the
app server refuses the call, does not answer, or the item never shows - the answer here is
"unknown", and core holds the record as an uncertain submission, never sent again, exactly as it
holds one of `codex queue`'s; the tripwire for a paid send that went unknown turns this capability
off (arming.py). Only a failure before anything was asked of Codex - no app server could be
started, or the words are not ones core would send - is "not started", which core may retry.

It answers for every send, and the runtime stands it aside for one it cannot carry (v0.6.17, issue #42): a
continuation queued for when its conversation is opened, or sent to another Codex session (P16's QUEUE_FOR_OPEN and
TO_SESSION), goes only through core's backend with its marker, so for that send its answers at P5 and P15 are not
taken and are journalled as overruled (runtime.OVERRULERS). Every other send - a conversation the app holds - it
serves as before.

No test opens a real Codex: the tests give the channel a session over a fake app server, and the
live session is opened only by a watcher that has this capability armed.
