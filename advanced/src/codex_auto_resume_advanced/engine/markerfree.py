# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""Marker-free continuation: the advanced edition's answer at P5 and P15.

The standard edition sends every continuation with `codex queue` and ends its words with a short
marker, `[codex-auto-resume:<16 hex>]`, which is how it proves the message arrived and finds the
turn it started (A2, A4). This capability sends the words with no marker. Asked at P15 it answers
CLIENT_ID, and asked at P5 it names itself as the channel; core then derives a client id from the
interruption (ids.continuation_client_id - the same interruption, the same id), writes it into the
record before the claim, and hands this channel the words and that id for the one send. The
channel adds one item to the conversation's queue through Codex's own app server -
`thread/queue/add` with `clientUserMessageId`, the call measurement M7 made - and Codex keeps the
id on the message as `clientId`. That call changes Codex's state through its app server, which the
standard edition never asks it to (B3, B4), so the statement names those two standards as well
as A2 and A4. Core proves delivery by that id and by nothing else
(engine/delivery.py in core), and follows, takes back and settles the record by it exactly as it
does one with a marker.

What this code does not do is decide anything: every gate, the claim, the pre-send look and the
launch guard are core's, and so is what follows the send. Where the send cannot be proven - the
app server refuses the call, does not answer, or the item never shows - the answer here is
"unknown", and core holds the record as an uncertain submission, never sent again, exactly as it
holds one of `codex queue`'s; the tripwire for a paid send that went unknown turns this capability
off (arming.py). Only a failure before anything was asked of Codex - no app server could be
started, or the words are not ones core would send - is "not started", which core may retry.

It answers for every send (v0.6.17, issue #42). A continuation queued for when its conversation is opened (P16's
QUEUE_FOR_OPEN) it carries too - with no marker, under its client id, left in the queue for the person to open - only
where MQO passed for the Codex in force: that such an item, taken when the conversation is opened, is found in
Codex's history by its client id, which is how core proves this delivery (`carries`). Unmeasured or failed, and for
a continuation sent to another Codex session (TO_SESSION), which MQO does not cover, it stands aside for that send:
core's backend carries it with its marker, and the runtime journals it as overruled, naming queue_for_open or
other_sessions and why (runtime.CONFLICTS). Every other send - a conversation the app holds - it serves as before.

Beside Continue with no words (v0.6.17, #47 P-6) it serves the sends that carry words, and that capability the routes:
core asks a route's P15 with the record saying `route`, where only SILENT is taken (runtime._takes), so this answer is
passed over there - a turn with no words carries no marker either.

Beside Several conversations at once (v0.6.17, #47 P-7) its sends may wait for their receipts on workers, each add in a
session of its own under its own client id (`pools`), where MQP passed on the Codex in force: that several such adds at
once are each accepted and each lands only in its own conversation. Unmeasured or failed, its sends go one at a time,
as before, and the runtime journals parallel_dispatch as overruled for them and why.

No test opens a real Codex: the tests give the channel a session over a fake app server, and the
live session is opened only by a watcher that has this capability armed.
