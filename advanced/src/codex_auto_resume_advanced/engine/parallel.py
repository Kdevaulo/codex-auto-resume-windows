# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""Parallel dispatch: the advanced edition's answer at P12, how many sends may wait for their receipts at once
(v0.6.15-beta).

The standard edition sends one continuation after another on one thread, each waiting up to 45 seconds for Codex's
receipt before the next is looked at (A19: in sequence, under one lock). With this on, core lets two to four of them
wait at once - each in a conversation of its own, the claim refusing a second in one (core's I4) - while every gate,
every claim and every look stays on the tick, as before (core's engine/launches.py). What it answers is a number of
workers and nothing else: the person's Workers option, 2 by default - and 2 at most until MQ passes on the Codex in
force. The runtime pays one unit for each pooled claim (`acted` at CONCURRENCY), so a send of it whose fate cannot be
known turns it off like any paid send (K7).

It holds no memory of its own: what it reads is the state's, through its view (state.Scoped).
