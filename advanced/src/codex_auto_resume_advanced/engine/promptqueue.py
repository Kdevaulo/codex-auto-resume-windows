# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""The prompt queue (v0.6.15-beta, the plan's item 7, on reset_message's way): a person's queued messages go after the
current turn, at a time or on a schedule, in order, each once, and their words go once each has ended - at P2.

The standard edition sends one thing of its own, a continuation for a recovery that is due (A26, C4). With this on, a
person writes messages in the Dashboard for one conversation each (control/prompts.py): after the turn now running
(`after_turn`: due at once, it goes through Codex's own queue, which runs it when that turn ends - MT measures it), at a
time (`at_time`), or every day or week from a time (`recurring`, 30 occurrences and 30 days at most). Core sends each as
it sends a message at a reset (P2's MESSAGE: exactly as typed, its marker after a blank line), through its gates, the
one claim and the ledger's caps - one in flight in a conversation across both stores, fifteen minutes apart and five a
day in one conversation (A20 kept, the owner's answer of 2026-10-09).

At P2, each conversation's prompts in their order (`position`), the first still to go alone eligible:
* one whose conversation is off is cancelled; one over 2,000 characters while Longer messages is off, cancelled;
* `depends`: not due until the one before it in that conversation was delivered - ended any other way, it is held
  (dependency_failed) for the person to say go on or cancel;
* due, its occurrence is made - a record with an id of its own - and handed core with its words;
* a series' occurrences that fell while nothing ran are caught up once, the latest alone, the earlier counted as used
  (`missed`); an occurrence not sent a day after it fell due is used as expired, and the series goes on.

The words leave the disk when a one-time prompt's occurrence ends - delivered, or ended any other way - not at its
send: while Codex holds it they are kept, so a Pause that takes it back can send them again on Go on (state/prompts.py,
prompt_moved) - and at a series' end, at a cancel, at expiry, when the conversation is switched off and when this is
turned off (watched, they are kept - v0.6.16-beta.3). They never reach a log, the journal, diagnostics, a
notification, the status, MCP or a golden.
