# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""A message of a person's own, sent to the conversation they picked when the window they picked resets
(v0.6.14): reset_message, at P8, P2 and P3.

The standard edition sends one thing of its own: a continuation, from its own templates or the Custom
message, for a recovery that is due (A26, C4). With this on, a person writes a message in the Dashboard
for one conversation that is switched on, and picks an occasion - "when the next 5-hour limit resets",
"the 3rd reset from now", "when the weekly limit resets" (engine/resetwatch.py) - and when that window
resets, core sends it, once, as it sends its own continuations: through its gates, its one claim and its
one send, with the record's marker after a blank line (engine/plugrecords.py, P2). It goes exactly as
typed: nothing is filled in, and it is at most 2,000 characters unless Longer reset messages is on
(A27's bound, departed from only there).

* P8, the errand: the usage windows counted - core's own reading, and this edition's where one is due -
  and the rules adopted (engine/resetwatch.py).
* P2: first the windows closed by time, with no reading, so a message is due at the very tick its window
  closes; then every message due is handed core with its words, and every one in flight, to be watched.
  One whose conversation is found switched off is cancelled (H5: the switch itself cancels it, as it
  happens, runtime.conversation_off - this is for what that could not write); one unsent eight days after
  it was written, or a day after it fell due, has expired. Either way its words go.
* P3 `usage`: a core record of the same conversation is held while one of its messages is due or in
  flight, and while one counts for the very reset that record waits for - so when a continuation and the
  person's message wait for the same reset, only the message is sent, in the continuation's place (the
  owner's answer); a newer user turn then supersedes core's record (A17). Held at most thirty minutes
  after the message fell due (HOLD_FOR): one that cannot go by then holds no recovery longer (H7).

The runtime keeps what core tells it at P14 (runtime.py): sent, the words are gone; delivered, done;
unproven a day after it was sent, done as unknown, and the capability turns itself off (K7). The words
leave the disk at the send's start, at a cancel, at expiry, when the conversation is switched off (at the
switch itself: runtime.conversation_off) and when the capability stands anywhere but on (at the move
itself, state/resets.end_pending, and at the sweep for a policy that reads it down, arming.py); the file
refuses words on a finished rule (state/schema.py). They never reach a log, the journal, diagnostics, a
notification, the status, MCP or a golden.
