# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""Continue with no words (v0.6.15-beta.3, P15; headless only).

The standard edition always ends a continuation's words with its marker and proves delivery by finding it (A4), and
its words are always a shipped template's or the Custom message (A26). With this on, P15 answers SILENT: core carries
it out only through a route that takes words - a turn run here (codex/headless.py) - which it then calls with no
words at all, under the client id it derives from the interruption, and proves delivery by that id (P15's own
machinery: nothing new is stored). Through `codex queue`, or any channel, core ignores it and sends the words with
the marker: M3 found Codex refuses an empty queue item, so that route is not offered.

It continues nothing by itself: it changes only how headless_run's turn, or compact_continue's continuation, starts.
Until M3B - a turn started with no input, proven by its id - passes for the Codex in force, its statement carries the
UNMEASURED warning. Where Codex refuses a turn with no input, the route answers "not started" with Codex's refusal,
and from then on this answers DEFER for that Codex in this process - so the next attempt carries words (the review's
finding: a kept-on capability is not turned off by a trip) - and it trips (REFUSED_BY_CODEX).
