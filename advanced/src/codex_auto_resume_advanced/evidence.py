# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""One content-free record per measurement, in the live-acceptance envelope, in docs/evidence/live/.

The measurement harness (measure.py) writes what it observed here, in the same JSON envelope
`scripts/live_evidence.py` reads and holds every committed file to: a format tag, when it was
recorded, which product build and which Codex and Windows it ran against, and the observation.
The tag is this harness's own (`MEASUREMENT_FORMAT`), so the validator does not count these
towards release acceptance and does not know their steps - but it still refuses any of them that
names a person, a path or a conversation, and so does this writer, first, by construction: a
record holds booleans, counts, the engine's own closed words, verdicts, and ids only as the
aliases the diagnostics export writes. Anything else is refused rather than written, so a
measurement can never be the thing that publishes what the whole product is careful to keep in.

The directory is the source tree's `docs/evidence/live/`, because the owner runs the harness
from the source on a throwaway conversation, never against the real install (agents never do).
An installed copy has no such directory, and the writer says so rather than inventing one.
