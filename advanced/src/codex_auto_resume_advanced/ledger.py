# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""P11: the one claim, counted across both editions' records and paid for before it is granted.

Core asks the plug's ledger last, inside `reserve_detailed`'s BEGIN IMMEDIATE and on its
connection, once every check of core's own has passed (store/claims.py). The ledger ATTACHes
advanced.sqlite to that connection there, so everything below is read and written under the one
lock the claim already holds, and commits with the claim or not at all - core takes back what it
wrote with a savepoint when it holds, or raises.

Two things are decided:

* The caps on one conversation, counted across both tables. Core allows one continuation in
  flight per conversation, five claims in 24 hours and fifteen minutes between them, and counts
  them in its own rows. This edition's records are claims too, so the claim is held when one of
  them is in flight on the conversation, or when they make the difference to the five or the
  fifteen minutes. With no record of this edition's on the conversation it holds nothing, so an
  installation with nothing on claims exactly what the standard edition claims.
* Spend before send. Each armed capability whose answer this dispatch carries - its words, its
  channel - pays one unit here, in the spend ledger, before the claim that leads to the send is
  granted. No unit left under its own ceilings or the global one, or a capability turned off
  since it answered, and the claim is held: a disarm always wins, and a ceiling is never passed.

* A person's Send now (v0.6.14), SEND_NOW at P7: only with that capability's request of this very
  record, unused, under fifteen minutes old and made since the capability last stood where it stands
  (control/sendnow.py), which the claim uses - one click, one claim.
* A resend (v0.6.14), RESEND at P7: only one per standard record, by any capability - no RESEND_ONCE
  of it yet, and one written now, open for the sweep's duplicate watch (arming.py); and, for one paid
  by a capability that does not resend itself, only while it is kept on with Send again in the row
  this claim reads - not in the runtime's few seconds old states - so Send again turned off after P7
  answered sends nothing.

* A record of this edition's own (v0.6.14, P2): a message a person wrote, claimed in core's claim of it and
  launched in its launch guard (`record`), each with its `phase` - counted across both tables and paid for
  as a send is.

HOLD is all this can say. It never grants anything core would refuse.
