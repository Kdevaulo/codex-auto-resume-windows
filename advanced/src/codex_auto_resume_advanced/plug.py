# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""The one module core imports from this package: the interface it was written for, and its plug.

`codex_auto_resume/edition.py` imports this, takes the plug only when PLUG_API is the number
core was built with, and calls `create` once for each home. Anything that goes wrong on the way
leaves the installation running as the standard edition, with a badge that says so.

Every hook hands its question to the runtime (runtime.py), which asks the registry's
capabilities in the state each one is in; the claim ledger (P11) and the surfaces (P10) are the
plug's own. Nothing is opened, read or written until a hook needs it, and with no capability -
as this version ships - every decision point answers as NULL does.
