# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""The capability registry: every capability this edition can offer, and what each one is.

A capability is a definition here plus its code. The definition says everything a person is
asked to agree to and everything the plug holds it to:

* `id` - its closed name, the one every table, surface and journal line uses;
* `kind` - a ROUTE, which answers at plug points, or an ACTION, which answers at none: core never
  asks an action, it sends nothing to Codex and spends nothing, so it has no points, stands on no
  compatibility capability, rests on no measurement and has no ceilings - its own bounds are its
  code's, and a person in the Dashboard starts each thing it does (vocabulary.CapabilityKind);
* `points` - the plug points its code answers at (domain/plug.py), and no others;
* `revision` - the revision of its statement: the five fields in `statement.py`'s catalogs, in
  every language the product has a catalog for. Arming names the revision the person read, and a new revision turns the
  capability off until they have read that one (a tripwire, arming.py);
* `departs_from` - the standards it breaks (standards.py). Never empty: a capability that keeps
  every standard belongs in the standard edition, so the rule for which edition a capability is
  in is this field. Only the standard edition's standards may be named (standards.DEPARTABLE):
  family K is the advanced edition's own rules, which every capability keeps;
* `compat` - the Compatibility Registry capability it stands on. Its grade here is shown in the
  statement - FAILED_HERE, INCOMPATIBLE or UNKNOWN as a warning the person confirms - and a
  failure the person did not confirm turns it off (arming.py);
* `measurements` - the measurements its route rests on (measure.py), if any. One that failed, or
  has no pass for the Codex in force (measured.py), is a warning in its statement, never a
  reason to withhold it;
* `ceilings` - how many sends it may make in a day, overall and in one conversation. Beside them
  stands one global ceiling for every capability together, GLOBAL_HOURLY an hour, which a person
  may lower and never raise (state.AdvancedState.set_global_hourly). One conversation's ceiling is
  never above core's own five a day (CORE_DAILY_CAP) unless the capability says it departs from
  A20, the standard that sets them;
* `options` - the choices it offers a person in the Dashboard (`Option`): a key, the values it may
  take, smallest first, and the one it has until a person picks another. Stored in the state's
  `options` table, read by the capability's own code (state.Scoped);
* `rules_editor` and `samples` - whether the Dashboard shows it the rules a person writes for
  Codex's error codes, and whether it keeps samples of the failures it takes up (state/choices.py);
* `journal_prefix` and `codes` - the words its own journal lines are written in, `<prefix>.<code>`,
  closed like every other word the edition stores;
* `resends` - whether what it does is send an uncertain continuation once more (v0.6.14): such a
  capability answers at P7, is turned off by a resend of its found twice whether or not it is kept on,
  and is never given Keep on's Send again, which would be itself (arming.py);
* `requires` - the ids of other capabilities this one needs on (v0.6.16-beta.3, the owner's rule: a
  capability that needs another, or that makes another turn on, turns both on). Turning this one on
  turns on what it requires in the same confirmation (one yes, both statements), and turning a required
  one off turns off what requires it; a required one an administrator's policy forbids, or whose
  compatibility is Failed here, keeps the dependent off, with that reason (arming.py). Never names
  itself, and the registry is acyclic (Registry rejects a cycle when it is made);
* `keepable` - whether a person may keep it on (K8; v0.6.16-beta.4): False for one whose tripwire is what stops it
  doing harm, which Keep on would turn into a note (arming.py refuses it);
* `make` - the factory for its code: given the installation's paths, it returns an object whose
  methods are the plug's hooks for its points, each answering as a plug would.

The edition ships these capabilities now: start-with-Codex, at P9 (control/codexstart.py); the
goal continuation, at P16, P3 and P5 (engine/goal.py); the marker-free continuation, at P5 and
P15 (engine/markerfree.py); and, from v0.6.14 (stage 3b), those that take up failures at P17 and
relax their records at P3: the short retries when Codex is at capacity (engine/capacity.py), the
rules for Codex's error codes, the retries of failures nothing classified, of Codex giving up and
of a sign-in failure (engine/admitted.py); at P8 and P7, a reset credit used at the limit a person picked
(engine/credits.py), and at P8, P2 and P3 a message of a person's own sent when the window they picked resets
(engine/resetmessage.py); and, at P7 and P3, the notice of a usage limit that lifts early (engine/earlyreset.py); at P7, an uncertain continuation sent once more (engine/oncemore.py),
and one waiting recovery a person asks to send now (control/sendnow.py); at P12, several conversations at once
(engine/parallel.py); at P16, a conversation queued in Codex for when it is opened (engine/foropen.py); and, at no
point, two actions: longer
reset messages, and the compatibility report (report/). The tests define one of their own to hold every
rule here.

# says so (arming.listing marks a non-sending capability). Its journal is the runtime's own -
# WOULD_HAVE where it is watched, ACTED where it names a route - and, from v0.6.16-beta.3 (issue
# #31), what core made of that route, in its own codes (core's control/codexstart.OUTCOMES, told to
# the route), and `held` where it was on and named none: held back by what Codex is, or by a policy,
# so a start that did not happen is in the journal as one that did is. It departs from C4 (nothing at start) and F6 (a
# process-creation route beyond the listed ones), rests on engine_present (the installed Codex is
# the one we start a watcher for, with local checks), and on measurement MW (the WMI escape still
# leaves a process outside the job); a version of Codex MW has not passed for is a warning in its

# a conversation the app does not hold, it is the route core carries out at P16 - the conversation's
# goal, paused by the limit, set active again through the app server's thread/goal/set, an existing
# goal only and never its words - so Codex carries the goal on when the app next opens it (M2: a goal
# set so is not seen while the app holds the conversation, and is live once it loads it again). At
# P3 it holds the standard continuation back while that goal is active, so the two never both run;
# at P5, only where M2b passed for the Codex in force, it is the channel that sets the goal active
# before the continuation it queues. Anywhere else the standard queue route stands.

# through the queue and the plugin command) and B4 (the app server's three methods). It stands on
# loaded_state_detection - whether the app holds the conversation, with local checks, which is what
# decides its route - and reads the goals table's columns itself at every use, doing what the
# standard edition does where they are not there. Core's own goal_continuation entry in the
# Compatibility Registry has no local check and stays 'unsupported' (G12), as the standard
# edition's. Its route rests on M2, which failed for a conversation the app holds - a warning in its
# statement the person confirms; M2b only widens where it acts, and is read where it is used.
# Ceilings: three a conversation a day - a usage limit resets a few times a day at most - and a dozen
# a day in all. It comes before the marker-free continuation, so where both are on and the goal
# applies its channel carries the send, under the client id P15 gives it.
