# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""The compatibility report as the Dashboard drives it: write, save, check, send - each the person's.

The capability's code (registry.COMPAT_REPORT, an action: core never asks it anything). The bridge's
report commands (surfaces.py) are its only way in, and only the Dashboard's long-lived bridge reaches
them. Writing, checking and sending are jobs - each on a thread of this process, its status read with
advanced-report-job - because the Dashboard ends a call after thirty seconds and asks the one-shot
bridge instead, which never reaches the plug; saving is a call of its own.

Every command is answered in one order (design C.5): a job's status first, whatever stands - it reads
no file, asks nothing and starts nothing, so a send stopped by a turn-off, a policy or a pause still
shows what it wrote; then an administrator's policy; then where the capability stands - off refuses
everything, watched allows writing and saving and refuses checking and sending; then, for checking and
sending, the pause (K5); then the arguments; then one job at a time; then, for sending, the typed word
and the writes the person read.

One check or send runs at a time for each home, across every Dashboard window and process: its thread
holds the home's report mutex (ReportMutex) from its first question to GitHub to its last write, so the
re-check a send starts with and the writes it makes are one step.

A send that ended part way - its service ended while it wrote: the window closed or reopened, or a
call passed thirty seconds - is told by the next check here (`interrupted`), and from what is on
GitHub: the report's branch left on the person's fork with no pull request of it open is what such a
send leaves, whoever's it was, and nothing here is written to remember it. The mutex tells it too,
abandoned, but only where another window had it open when its holder died: Windows makes a mutex
nobody else had open anew.

A send asks GitHub again first and writes nothing unless what sending would write is still exactly
what the person read; before every write it reads again where the capability stands, the policy and
the pause, and stops with what it had written. Only the word `send`, exactly, sends.

What a report holds, its bytes and every status are kept in this process's memory and nowhere else;
the journal gets one closed code a step (`rpt.<code>`) and is never read to decide anything. A fault
of this code - anything but a refusal - turns the capability off (hook_exception).
