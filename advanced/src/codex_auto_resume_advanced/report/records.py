# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""This PC's own records, read for a compatibility report - and never written, migrated or locked.

The same files codex-compat-reporter 1.5.0 reads, read the same way (its state_rows, paid_claims,
log_lines, installed_codex and progress_items), so that the two write the same report of the same
records (advanced/tests/test_advanced_report_records.py holds them to what 1.5.0 wrote):

    config/state.sqlite           the 17 columns the report needs, the count of records hidden
                                  with Clear history, and the recovery switch (a pause)
    config/advanced/advanced.sqlite
                                  the spend ledger's interruption_id and at, its count, its oldest
                                  unit and how many units SQLite ever gave it (sqlite_sequence)
    logs/auto-resume.log and its five rotated copies
                                  the engine lines and their local times
    config/compatibility.json     the watcher's own report, through compatio.reader_view only
    Codex's history               how many items of four kinds a recovered turn made, through core's
                                  read-only opener (codex/schema.py `_db`): counts, never text

Never through the Store, which makes its directory and opens the file writable: each database is
opened `mode=ro`, with query_only on, trusted_schema off and a three-second timeout, so nothing is
written beside it - no -journal, no folder - and nothing is migrated. A link, a reparse point or a
path out of the home is refused. A schema newer than this reads is refused, not read as today's.

A refusal is one closed code (`ReadRefusal`) and nothing else: never an id, a path, a login or
text. What the records say is evidence.py's, which is pure. The one import of the rest of the
advanced package is the ledger's own schema and bounds, taken where they are written (state/),
not copied, and only when the ledger is read.
