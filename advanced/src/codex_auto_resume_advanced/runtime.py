# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""The registry's capabilities, asked at the plug's points, each in the state a person put it in.

At every point the plug is asked at, each capability whose code answers there is taken in the
registry's order, and what it may do depends only on where it stands (arming.py):

* off: it is not asked at all;
* watched (shadow): it is asked, and whatever it answers is written to the journal as what it
  would have done - never taken, never spent, never a reason to move it anywhere;
* on (armed): its answer is taken. A restriction - HOLD - is taken at once, from any of them.
  Anything else is taken from the first that gives one, and where it leads to a send of the
  record it was given, only while its ceilings have a unit left; the unit itself is spent at the
  claim, before the claim is granted (ledger.py).

Only an answer core would take counts at all. Core checks every answer as it checks its own
(domain/plug.py's consult and Guarded, and the Custom message's validator for words), and the
same checks are made here first, so a capability is never journalled, counted or paid for an
answer core would not carry out; anything else is DEFER, as it is to core. Words that pass the
validator and still fill in to nothing for a record are the one answer core can drop after this -
it sends the person's own style instead - so what is paid for at the claim is what core says
there the send carries (P11's `carried`), never this runtime's own list of what it answered:
dropped words are journalled as taken, and cost nothing.

A hook that raises trips its own capability and costs its own answer, nothing more - or, for one kept
on (K8, arming.py), stays on and skips that one recovery: it is passed over for that record from then
on, and core goes its own way with it.

Keep on's Send again (v0.6.14): at P7, for an uncertain submission, the capability that paid for its
send and is kept on with Send again answers RESEND before any capability's own hook is asked
(arming.Arming.resender) - one answer like any other, journalled, under its ceilings, and paid for at
the claim, which reads Send again's words once more (ledger.py). What each answer was is kept with it
until the claim, so the ledger pays for a resend, or a person's Send now, only where it was that.

With no capability at a point, nothing is read and nothing is written: the answer is NULL's.

Taking failures up (v0.6.14, stage 3b). At P17 an answer is taken only if core offered it - one of
the `takes` core hands over (failures.takes) - and only for a failure that completed after the
capability was last turned on or watched: arming never reaches back. A capability that takes one up
is remembered as the one that did, with its word (state/choices.py, admissions). At P3 such a word
is taken only at known_failure, and only from that capability with that very word, so none relaxes a
record it did not take up, or at another gate. A record core never recovers alone that it took up
waits, where the state cannot be read or its capability has no unit left, and ends only where a read
that worked found nothing holding it; a capacity error is never parked so - the standard edition's
handling is what it falls back to. From v0.6.14 a record is relaxed only while its capability has
stood on ever since it took the record up: turned off, watched or read down by the policy in between,
however briefly, the record ends unsent at its next look, though the capability stands on again then.
The first time core goes on with a record a capability took up, the capability is told (`taken`) and
what it keeps of it - a sample, a rule's hit - is written with the mark that it was told, in one
transaction, once.
