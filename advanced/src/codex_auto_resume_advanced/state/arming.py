# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""Where each capability stands, as stored: the arming rows, the generation and the ceiling.

A row that is not off also holds what the person confirmed when they moved it there: the
statement revision, for "on" the Codex version, and the statement's warnings (ArmingWarning),
which arming.standing reads so that a warning they confirmed never trips what they turned on.

This is only the writing. Who may move a capability, and when, is `arming.py`'s to decide; here
each move is one transaction that checks its words, bumps the generation and journals itself.

Keep on (v0.6.14, K8) is a row in `options` (KeepOn), set and let go for a capability that is on (from
v0.6.16-beta.4; watched before), a move like any other but for `since`, which it never touches; every move to off or
to watching takes it away, and an arm can set it with the move (move_set's `keep`: Keep it on turns it on). Send again (v0.6.14) is a second row beside it, only ever with it. A kept-on capability's notice - what would have turned it off - is its row's `reason`, which a
row that is not off held nowhere before: written only as it rises (KEPT_NOTICES), with no generation,
and taken away by the next arm, the person confirming again.

The generation is one number for the whole table, raised by every move of every capability. A
request to turn something on names the generation it was made against, and is refused if any
move came in between - so a person who turned a capability off, anywhere, cannot have that
undone by a Dashboard that had not yet seen it. A move to off names none: nothing ever stands
in the way of turning something off.
