# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""What the capabilities that take failures up keep (v0.6.14, stage 3b): choices, rules, admissions
and samples, and the one view of them a capability's own code is given.

    options     a capability's own choices (registry.Option), set by a person in the Dashboard: a
                value it offers, or the default where none was set or one stored is not offered
    rules       up to ten rules a person wrote: one of Codex's own error codes, if they like a range
                of status numbers, and the temporary kind to treat it as. A code the product already
                classifies, one that may name a person's decision, a kind that is not temporary, a
                second rule over the same code and numbers - each is refused (`rule_problem`)
    admissions  which capability took up which interruption at P17, with the word, and the rule or
                the failure's shape where it keeps one - upserted, so a failure asked again is taken up
                again and never twice counted
    samples     what a capability that samples keeps of a failure it took up and nothing classified:
                Codex's code, a status number, the error's form, whether a message existed, item
                counts, a time to the minute and a duration - never a word of the error or the
                conversation

Choices and rules are written only by a person in the Dashboard (arming.py), against the generation
the page read, and each write moves the generation like any move: a page showing old choices cannot
arm against new ones. Admissions and samples are the runtime's (runtime.py); a capability's code reads
its own through `Scoped`, and writes nothing.
