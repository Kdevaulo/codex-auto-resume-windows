# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""What the advanced edition says happened, and the counts its sampler keeps - both bounded.

The journal is content-free and closed like core's (store/journal.py): a capability id, a code,
and the reason, actor, point and answer as words from closed lists. A word outside them is
written as "other", or not at all, and never fails the move it describes. And like core's, it is
never read to decide anything: the spend ledger is the only record a decision counts.

Everything here is bounded the way core's journal is - 5,000 entries or 90 days, whichever comes
first, pruned every 256 entries - and so are the spend ledger, the records, the overrides, the
admissions and the samples, which are pruned in the same pass. A spend is never pruned inside the day its ceilings count,
and a record or an override that may still be acted on never at all. What a watched capability would have
done (`would_have` lines) is bounded tighter, inside those: at most WATCH_LIMIT lines a capability, its
newest, cut in the same pass before the journal's own bound, so one noisy watched capability never
pushes another's out (between passes one can hold up to WATCH_LIMIT + 255); the journal's own bound
then cuts every other line before any of them.
