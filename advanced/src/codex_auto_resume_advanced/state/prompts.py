"""A person's queued prompts (version 4, v0.6.14-beta.2): their own words for one conversation, to go after the turn
now running, at a time, or on a schedule - in order, each once.

    prompts   one row a prompt: its conversation, its words while one is still to go, when it goes (after_turn,
              at_time at `at`, recurring every day or week from `at`, at most 30 occurrences and never past
              `until`, 30 days from when it was written at most), whether it waits for the one before it to be
              delivered (`depends`), its place in its conversation's queue, where it stands, and the record of its
              current occurrence - a row of `records` (state/records.py) with an id of its own, which the one
              claim counts with core's rows (ledger.py)

The file refuses words on a prompt that is done or cancelled, a series past 30 occurrences or 30 days, and a
recurring prompt without its every; this module refuses the rest: twenty waiting in all, five to a conversation.
