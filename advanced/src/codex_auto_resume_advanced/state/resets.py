# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""What the reset actions keep (v0.6.14): the usage windows they count, the last reading, their rules and
their spends.

    windows        one row for each usage window a pending rule names - a bucket and a length in minutes,
                   never a slot - with the reset it is open until, whether it filled, when it last closed,
                   how many times it reset and filled (both only ever grow), when it was last seen and how
                   many readings in a row did not show it (engine/resetwatch.py)
    readings       one row: when this edition last read usage itself and asked to, the last reading counted,
                   the last usage-limit record of core's it noticed - and, only while reset_credit is on,
                   how many reset credits there are and when the soonest expires (B10)
    reset_rules    a person's rules: use a reset credit when the chosen limit is reached (reset_credit), or
                   send their own message to one conversation when the chosen window resets
                   (reset_message), each with the occasion it waits for, what it has counted and where it
                   stands - and, for a message still to be sent, its words. Words are held by a message
                   that is counting, due or held, and by nothing else: the file refuses them on a rule that
                   is done or cancelled, and on a credit's rule
    credit_spends  each credit this edition asked Codex to spend, under the key it was asked with, one for
                   each filling of a window at most, and what came of it

A message's own record is a row of `records` (state/records.py), which the one claim counts with core's
rows (ledger.py); its words are here, never there.
