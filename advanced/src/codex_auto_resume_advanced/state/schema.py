# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""The tables of advanced.sqlite, as they are created today, and the steps from the first two.

Eleven tables and nothing else - the state is refused at open if it holds any other, or any
other column, exactly as core refuses its own (store/session.py). Every word a decision reads is
checked twice: by the code that writes it (state/session.py) and by a CHECK here, built from the
same closed vocabulary, so not even a hand-edited row can put a word in that the code does not
know.

    meta       one row: the arming generation, and the global ceiling a person may lower
    arming     one row per capability that has ever been moved: off, shadow or armed, and for
               one that is not off, the statement's warnings the person confirmed
    spend      one row per unit a capability spent - the only thing its ceilings count
    records    the edition's own records, counted with core's in every claim (ledger.py)
    overrides  what a capability asks of one standard record, keyed by its interruption id
    journal    content-free lines of what happened, bounded like core's (state/journal.py)
    sampler    per-day counts of a capability's own codes, bounded the same way
    options    a capability's own choices a person made in the Dashboard (registry.Option), and
               whether they keep it on (KeepOn)
    rules      the rules a person wrote for Codex's error codes, ten at most, never pruned
    admissions which capability took up which interruption at P17, with the word it took it up
               with - and, for one that samples, the failure's shape - pruned at 90 days
    samples    failures a capability took up that nothing classified: Codex's error code, a status
               number, the error's form, item counts and times, and never a word of any message

Version 2 added `arming.warnings` (the owner's rule of 2026-09-26: a warning is confirmed, not
refused). A version-1 file - v0.6.11-alpha's, where lowering the global ceiling makes one - is
brought to version 2 when it is opened (UPGRADE_FROM_1): the column is added, every row keeps
what it held, and a row with no warnings confirmed none, which is the strictest reading.

Version 3 (v0.6.14, stage 3b) added four tables, for the capabilities that take failures up, and the
reset actions' four (v0.6.14):

    windows        the usage windows a pending rule names, and what was counted of each
    readings       one row: the last usage reading counted, and - only while reset_credit is on - the
                   count of reset credits and the soonest expiry
    reset_rules    a person's rules for a reset credit or a message of their own at a reset they chose
    credit_spends  each reset credit this edition asked Codex to spend, under its key

A version-2 file is brought to it when it is opened (UPGRADE_FROM_2), and a version-1 file takes both
steps; every table that was there keeps every row. No release wrote a version-3 file before the reset
actions joined it, but a pre-release build of this beta may have, so a version-3 file with the first four
tables and not the last four is given them (ADD_RESETS), keeping every row, its version unchanged. A
version this one does not know is refused, as before: a downgrade leaves the state unreadable, which is
every capability off.
