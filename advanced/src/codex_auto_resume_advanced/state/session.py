# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""advanced.sqlite: where it is, opening it, and the transaction everything is written in.

It lives in config/advanced/ (config.Paths.advanced_dir), a directory of its own with the same
provenance marker config/ carries, because the core state cannot hold any of it: the core store
refuses a state.sqlite with one table more than its own (store/session.py), and settings.json
drops every key it does not define on the next save (settings.py). The marker is what lets core
purge the directory without knowing a single file in it (config.owned_advanced_files).

The same rules as core's store: no link anywhere on the way, nothing outside the home, one
connection per process opened the first time it is needed, BEGIN IMMEDIATE for every write and
synchronous=FULL, and a file whose tables, columns or version are not exactly these is refused
rather than repaired - but for a file of an earlier version, exactly as that version made it, which
is brought to this version when it is opened (schema.UPGRADE_FROM_1, UPGRADE_FROM_2, ADD_RESETS), a read's
opening too: it is the one write a read makes, and it adds a column and tables and changes no row - and for a file of
a later version marked readable from this one (schema.READABLE_FROM, v0.6.17), which is used as it is, nothing
upgraded and nothing taken away. Reading never creates the file: an
installation where nothing was ever turned on has none, and every question about it has the
answer "off".

The one connection serves every thread of its process - the MCP server asks P9 on a thread of
its own, the watcher's tray popup calls the plug its engine thread holds - so it is not bound to
the thread that opened it, and a lock gives each transaction the connection whole. Bound, it was
whichever thread's opened it first, and every other thread's disarm and badge failed.
