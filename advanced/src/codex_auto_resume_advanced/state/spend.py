# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""The spend ledger: one row for every unit a capability spent, and the counts its ceilings read.

A unit is spent before the send it pays for - inside core's one claim, on the claim's own
connection with this file attached (ledger.py) - so it commits with the claim or not at all, and
a crash after it can only have spent too much, never too little. It is never given back, not
even when the claim is, since nothing can prove the send it paid for never reached Codex.

The same statements serve both connections: this file's own, where its tables are `main`, and
core's, where it is attached as `advanced`. The schema name is one of those two constants and is
never taken from anything else.

A capability's own ceilings count its rows, one for each unit it spent. The global hourly ceiling
counts claims, not rows (v0.6.17): every capability whose answer one send carries pays its own unit
there, and the person is told that ceiling in sends - "Sends an hour, all advanced features
together" - so two capabilities riding one send are one send against it, and the next send the
hour's twelfth, not its sixth.
