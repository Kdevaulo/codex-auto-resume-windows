# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""What a person reads before a capability is turned on: its statement, in their own language.

Every capability has one, in five fields - what it does, what the standard edition does
instead, the standards it departs from, what can go wrong and how to stop it - and in every one
of the product's languages (l10n.LOCALES, the held ones too). It has a revision (registry.CapabilityDef.revision): arming names
the revision the person read, and a statement that changes afterwards turns the capability off
until they have read the new one.

The words live in this package's own catalogs, `locales/<locale>.json`, one per language, and
are held to core's rules by core's own code (`l10n.read_catalog`, `l10n.fill`): UTF-8 JSON, text
only, no key twice, English as the layer every other language is laid over, `{name}`
placeholders filled and nothing else touched. A capability's fields are the keys
`statement.<id>.<field>`; the titles of the fields, the words for the three states and the
kill switch's name are this edition's own and ship now, with no capability yet. So do the words
of the warnings a statement shows above its fields (`warning.<word>`, vocabulary.ArmingWarning),
with their title and the note that none of them stops the person turning the capability on.

The first key of every catalog is `_edition`, which holds the line every shipped file of this
edition carries, for the audit of the standard archive to look for.
