# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""P10: what this edition adds to the status, the bridge and MCP.

The edition badge is the first of them, and the only one this version shows: the word the
version-bearing surfaces already carry gains one that says which edition this is
(decision C12). Core asks the plug at the status, the tray snapshot and the diagnostics
bundle, and the standard edition's NULL plug adds nothing there, so those surfaces are
byte-identical to today; this edition adds `edition` and how many capabilities are armed
(`on`, 0 while the registry is empty), in codes only - no version string, no path, no free
text, because the status is part of what Codex sends on. The display word for each locale
lives in this package's own catalogs (`edition.*`); core surfaces keep their own words. Since the
v0.6.11 final, core itself names the edition beside the version (the status's `edition`,
edition.shown) - since v0.6.14 only this edition, the standard edition's word is shown nowhere - so
what this badge adds there is the count.

The bridge is the Dashboard's (controlcli.serve, the long-lived form; the one-shot form never
reaches a plug). It is where the Dashboard's Advanced features page takes its words from (the
window's catalog is core's, and holds none of this edition's), and where a person reads a
capability's statement and turns it on, watches
it, turns it off, turns everything off, lowers the global ceiling, or runs a measurement by
hand (`measure <id>`, measure.py), or writes, saves, checks and sends a compatibility report
(report/flow.py, which starts gh, the GitHub CLI, as `measure` starts a session), or reads what a
watched capability would have done (`advanced-watch-log`, watchlog.py), or sets, lists and cancels the reset
actions' rules - a reset credit at the limit a person picked, their own message at the reset they picked - and uses a
reset credit now (control/resets.py) - every request made as the Dashboard. The statement carries
the warnings that hold now and the Codex version an "on" acknowledges; the request to turn it on
sends both back as the person's confirmation, and a warning is never what refuses it
(arming.py).

MCP is a model's. It can list the capabilities, turn one off and turn all of them off, and that
is all: turning something off only ever does less, as a Pause does. There is no tool that turns
anything on, and nothing a client sends reaches `Arming.arm` from here - not an unknown tool, not
an argument the schema does not name (advanced/tests/test_advanced_surfaces.py). Turning a
capability on follows the Custom message's precedent: written only in the Dashboard, by the
person it will act for.

What MCP is told is codes and ids, like core's own status there: no version string, no path, no
free text, since a reply is part of what Codex sends on.
