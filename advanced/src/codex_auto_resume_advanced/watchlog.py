# ADVANCED-EDITION-CODE: in the advanced edition's archive, never the standard one's.
"""What a watched capability would have done: the journal's first reader, and its only one.

While a capability is watched ("Watch first"), the runtime asks it as it would ask it on and takes
none of its answers: each answer it would have acted on is written to the journal as one
`would_have` line - the capability, the point, the answer's word and the time (runtime.Runtime.ask,
`_send_again`). This module shows those lines, per capability, on the Advanced features page
(`view`, the Dashboard's `advanced-watch-log`) and in a diagnostics export the person asks for
(`exported`). It changes nothing that decides, sends or arms.

What a count means. The runtime writes one line for each (recovery, point, answer) in a watcher
process (runtime.Runtime._once): a recovery looked at a hundred times counts once. A watcher that
restarts, or the runtime's memory of what it noted filling (NOTED_LIMIT) and starting again, can
count one again; a point with no recovery (the tick, the start route) counts once a process. The
page says "once for each recovery"; this is the rest of it.

What it shows is content-free. Per capability, one entry per answer word - `{"answer", "points",
"count", "first", "last"}` - with every time in whole seconds rounded down to the minute, as the
samples are. The journal holds no id of a conversation, an interruption or a turn at all, so none
can leak. The words come from a closed list (WORDS): every alternative, and the points whose answer
is a value, which the journal writes as the point's name. Anything else reads as null ("Something
else"). Entries are grouped by answer, not by (point, answer). The vocabulary lets some words be
answered at more than one point - the take-up words at gates and admission, HOLD at gates, the
schedule and the claim ledger - but while watched only HOLD reaches the journal from two (gates and
the schedule): a take-up at gates needs the capability's own admission row, which only one that is
on writes (runtime.Runtime._takes), and the claim ledger is not a point the runtime asks. So the
page needs no point words; `points` keeps them for the export.

Read-only. It reads the stored arming rows (state.arming) and the journal (state.journal), and
never Arming.current, Arming.read or Arming.listing, which can carry out a trip. It opens no write
transaction and creates nothing: with no advanced file it answers empty. (A version-2 file is
brought to version 3 by any read of it, this one's as every other's - session.py.) So "watched
since" is the stored state: a capability a policy reads down to watched (ForceShadow) shows its
answers without the since-line.

Bounds: the journal keeps at most WATCH_LIMIT `would_have` lines a capability, its newest
(state/journal.py), and this shows the last WINDOW_DAYS of them - never more than WATCH_LIMIT, so
between two prune passes it counts what a pass would keep. Where the bound let older answers of the
window go - the count is at the bound and the oldest it counts is inside the window - it says from
when it counts (`full`, `from`). (With exactly WATCH_LIMIT ever written and none let go, it says so
too: the file cannot tell the two apart.)

The journal is never read to decide anything (D4): only this module calls `journal()` in this
package, and only surfaces.py imports it (advanced/tests/test_advanced_watch_log.py).
