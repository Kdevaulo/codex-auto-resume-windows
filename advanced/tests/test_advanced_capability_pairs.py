"""Two capabilities on at once, where one keeps the other from working (the v0.6.17 audit of capability pairs, the
owner's question after issue #42: "could other advanced capabilities overlap the way #42 did?").

Each test arms two shipped capabilities - their shipped definitions and statements - against core's own engine, store
and simulated Codex home (takingcase.py, test_advanced_goal.py), or against the runtime alone (advancedcase.py), and
asserts what a person who turned both on would expect. Each fails today, so each is marked expectedFailure with the
finding it shows; the fix that makes one pass removes its marker (an unexpected success fails the run).
