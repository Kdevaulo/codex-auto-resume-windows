"""What a release knows of the measurements (measured.py) is what the records beside it say.

The records are the source tree's docs/evidence/live/measurement-*.json; an installed copy has
only the table. A record re-measured - a blocked probe completed, a fail measured again as a
pass, a new Codex - fails here until the table follows it, so a statement never warns of what
the evidence no longer says, nor stays quiet about what it does.

Run from the repository root:
