"""The Dashboard's Advanced features page (advanced/gui/AdvancedPage.cs), in the window itself.

The advanced window is compiled from the standard window's sources and the overlay's, and loaded; the
page is driven through the window's own hooks (AdvancedPageRun, AdvancedLayoutAudit in
advanced/gui/AdvancedPageAudit.cs), the way tests/test_gui_layout.py drives the standard pages through
LayoutAudit. The window is never shown, and its bridge is rooted where nothing is: every reply it reads
is one this test hands it, made by this edition's real bridge (controlcli, surfaces, arming) in a
temporary home with a policy, a compatibility view and measurements of the test's own - so nothing here
reads the real installation, the real Software\\Policies keys or a real Codex.

Held here: the page's rows are every capability in the owner's order (registry.SHOWN_ORDER), by name and state in
the person's language; the open one shows its statement's five fields, its warnings, what a policy refuses
and its limits; Turn on and Watch first ask in the dialog with the statement and every warning, send
exactly what the page showed - which the real bridge then accepts - and ask again, with what holds now,
when the bridge says something changed, or say why they cannot (it could not be read again, or a policy
now refuses it); a refusal is told; a capability that turned itself off says so and why; Turn off and
Turn every advanced feature off send theirs; the hourly limit is a spin box, and the lowered limit is one
the real bridge takes; a capability's own choices are drop-downs whose choice is sent at once, the rules
for Codex's error codes are listed, added and removed, and the samples are listed, codes and numbers only -
each request one the real bridge takes, and each refusal told; what a watched capability would have done is a card last
in its column, answer words, counts and minutes only, read for every capability but an action; a capability on or watched can be kept on, with Send
again or without, after each warning, and let go - what a kept-on one noted shown in the accent - and Send now, while it
is on, offers each waiting recovery, asking first; the compatibility report - an action - says it sends nothing to
Codex where the others show their limits, and its card writes, shows, saves, checks and sends a report only as its
state allows, sends only on exactly the word send, holds the window's reopen while a check or a send runs, keeps
Turn off live meanwhile, shows a send it cannot account for as lost, and keeps the last ending once it is
off; the list is read again after every action and when the snapshot's badge says it
changed; the reset actions (v0.6.14) - a message at a reset and a reset credit's rules - are added from their
forms, which offer the windows, which reset, and the snapshot's conversations, asking first, and are cancelled, let
go on counting and used now, each request one the real bridge takes, and Pending shows each rule still to act with
Cancel, read when the status's counts change; Longer reset messages says what it lets a message be; a window that
reopens itself on the page comes back to it; the page is audited in every language at every scaling - Pending's
scheduled group too - its tabs on the narrowest screen too; and the standard window holds nothing of it.

GUI test module: compiles real executables, so it runs on its own.
