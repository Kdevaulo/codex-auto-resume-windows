"""The Dashboard's Advanced features page in the window itself: the list, Turn on and Watch, Turn off, the hourly
limit, a policy, a stale confirmation, a capability that turned itself off, the keys, the reopen and an installation
that cannot answer.

The window is compiled once for this module and every scenario_* below runs in one window process
(pagecase.PageCase); each makes its replies with this edition's real bridge in a home of its own, so nothing
here reads the real installation, the real Software\\Policies keys or a real Codex.

Held here: the page's rows are every capability in the owner's order (registry.SHOWN_ORDER), by name and state in
the person's language; the open one shows its statement's five fields, its warnings, what a policy refuses
and its limits; Turn on and Watch first ask in the dialog with the statement and every warning, send
exactly what the page showed - which the real bridge then accepts - and ask again, with what holds now,
when the bridge says something changed, or say why they cannot (it could not be read again, or a policy
now refuses it); a refusal is told; a capability that turned itself off says so and why; Turn off and
Turn every advanced feature off send theirs; the hourly limit is a spin box, and the lowered limit is one
the real bridge takes; the list is read again after every action and when the snapshot's badge says it
changed; Ctrl+Tab reaches the page; a window that reopens itself on the page comes back to it; and an
installation that cannot answer shows no tab.

GUI test module: compiles real executables, so it runs on its own.
