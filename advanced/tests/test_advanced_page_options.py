"""The Dashboard's Advanced features page in the window itself: a capability's own choices, the rules, the samples,
the watch log, Keep it on and Send now.

The window is compiled once for this module and every scenario_* below runs in one window process
(pagecase.PageCase); each makes its replies with this edition's real bridge in a home of its own, so nothing
here reads the real installation, the real Software\\Policies keys or a real Codex.

Held here: a capability's own choices are drop-downs whose choice is sent at once, the rules for Codex's
error codes are listed, added and removed, and the samples are listed, codes and numbers only - each
request one the real bridge takes, and each refusal told; what a watched capability would have done is a
card last in its column, answer words, counts and minutes only, read for every capability but an action; a
capability on or watched can be kept on, with Send again or without, after each warning, and let go - what
a kept-on one noted shown in the accent - and an action is never offered Send again; Send now, while it is
on, offers each waiting recovery, asking first.

GUI test module: compiles real executables, so it runs on its own.
