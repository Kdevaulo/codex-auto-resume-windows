"""The Advanced features page's card of the turns run here, and what Pending and History say of a row this edition
had a hand in (v0.6.16-beta.4, advanced/gui/AdvancedRuns.cs).

While Run a conversation here while Codex is closed (or Compact a full conversation, or the model fallback) is on, its
column has a card "Turns run here now": each run the status carries (surfaces.runs), a line naming its conversation
and the time its cap ends it, and Stop... under it, which asks first and sends advanced-headless-stop with that run's
interruption id; a Stop already asked reads "Stopping..." and offers no button. Turned off, there is no card. Pending's
and History's rows join this edition's words to their own lines (CellsWritten): the kind of a terminal's or VS Code's
conversation after its label, the /compact hint and a model not put back after its status, and a continuation with
no words after History's outcome. The window is driven as the other page modules drive it (pagecase.py).
