"""Make the Advanced features pictures (v0.6.16 final, before-after.md P1, P4, P5, P7 and P8): the real window, drawn
offscreen.

    python -X utf8 build/advanced_shots.py                    # every picture, in English and Korean, into docs/images
    python -X utf8 build/advanced_shots.py P1 P5 --locale ko  # some of them (P1 is P1-before and P1-after)
    python -X utf8 build/advanced_shots.py --out <folder>     # a proof: into <folder>, the manifest left alone
    python -X utf8 build/advanced_shots.py --list             # each picture, what it needs, what this tree lacks

Each picture is the window's client area drawn by the window itself in its render mode (gui/WindowRender.cs,
build/motion_window.py) - compiled from the working tree, the advanced edition's with advanced/gui/window.sources
after the standard sources - put in its caption, frame and corners from one captured still
(assets/screenshot-dashboard.png), as the README's motion is. Nothing is shown on the screen and nothing is captured.

What the window shows is answered from a scratch installation pinned as the stills' is (make_screenshots.
pinned_installation: the same records, clock, stand-in registry and synthetic Codex). For the advanced edition's
pictures its bridge runs with the advanced edition's own plug - a policy of none, the scratch installation's own
compatibility view, the pinned clock - and is seeded through that edition's own code, as a person's Dashboard would
seed it: each capability turned on or watched by the bridge's advanced-arm with the statement's warnings confirmed
(requirements with it), the reset message, the credit rule, the queued messages and the rule for an error code added
by their own bridge commands, and the samples of failures nothing classified kept by the state's own `admit` and
`taken`. No SQL is written here, so the seed follows the advanced state's schema as it moves (5 now; 6 with the
usage numbers; 7 with stage 4). The report's jobs, which the edition names at random, are renamed for what they are,
so the same tree gives the same answers and the same bytes.

What a picture needs of the advanced edition is named in NEEDS, the one table: a capability, a choice, a bridge
command, a module or a window source. A picture whose needs this tree does not have stops the run with "not in this
tree" before anything is drawn, and a page, a capability, a report or a Custom... the window cannot show stops the
render mode itself, so no picture is ever drawn of something else. Every read the window makes must be answered: one
that is not stops the run.

The two pictures of v0.6.16-beta.4's usage numbers, settled at the final's merge (plans/v0616-advshots/STOP-NOTES.md):

* P7-after, the Overview at 96 % of the five-hour window with the stop near a limit on. The status card's reason is the
  one the window draws - "Waiting" over the two recoveries, and under them the usage line, the five-hour window at 96 %
  and when it resets - because beta.4 holds core's records at their gate as any gate holds them (they keep waiting) and
  draws no words of its own on the Overview: a picture never shows what the product does not draw.
* P8, the usage meter's Choices card - both windows' warnings and each window's switch - scrolled to the top of the
  column (`show` "choices": the statement above it scrolled away), with the five-hour warning's drop-down holding 88%,
  a number of one's own, as one item before Custom... - as it shows a number its Custom... dialog took (`custom`, v0.6.16
  final): the one picture of "a Custom entry beside the presets". The meter is on, as in P7 (the near_limit seed), so
  the card is of a capability in use.

Into docs/images, the run first holds the window drawn offscreen to today's captured stills (motion_fidelity) and
records the result, each picture's digest and what it was made from in assets/advanced-shots.json; a page that fails
stops it. It needs Windows, the in-box C# compiler and the display at the stills' scale. Run it from the main session
after the stills are made, detached, under plans/proof/gui_lock.sh.
