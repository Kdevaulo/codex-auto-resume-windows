"""Prove, from the two archives' bytes, that the standard one holds nothing of the advanced edition.

The standard archive is built from a list of trees that does not name `advanced/`
(build/make_release.py), so it cannot hold the advanced code - by construction. This is the
proof that does not take the build script's word for it. It reads the archives that were built,
the repository they were built from, and nothing else, and fails the build on any of eight findings:

  (a) an entry of the standard archive lies where the advanced edition's files go;
  (b) an entry of the standard archive is, byte for byte, a file of the advanced tree;
  (c) a text entry of the standard archive spells an identifier the advanced tree declares, or
      the line every shipped advanced file begins with - except the few lines of edition
      machinery in ALLOWED, each with its reason. A name that is one English word, capitalised
      or in capitals, is looked for only as an identifier in code (`identifiers`);
  (d) one of our own executables in the standard archive holds a name or a string literal of
      the advanced window's C#;
  (e) the standard archive built again from `git archive HEAD`, with `advanced/` deleted before
      the build, is not the same file. This is the one that proves the standard bytes do not
      depend on the advanced tree at all: not merely that nothing of it is found, but that
      removing it changes nothing;
  (f) an entry of the standard archive is missing from the advanced one, or differs there -
      except the settings window, which each edition builds for itself, and the manifest's
      display name - or the advanced archive adds anything outside its own two places;
  (g) a binary entry holds the package's, the skill's or the sentinel's name, in UTF-8 or
      UTF-16, or is compiled Python outside the runtime - or is an archive the audit cannot
      open. (a), (b), (c) and (g) read every member of an entry that is itself a ZIP (`expand`)
      as they read an entry, so a zipped copy of the package is found where a copy would be;
  (h) a setup program (build/make_setup.py) does not carry its edition's archive byte for byte, or
      not its SHA-256; the standard one holds, outside the archive it carries, a name or a literal (d)
      looks for, the package's, the skill's or the sentinel's name, or the advanced archive's digest;
      or the standard one built again, around (e)'s rebuilt archive, is not the same file.

Run in the release build job after both archives and both setup programs are built:

    python build/edition_audit.py [--dist build/dist]

(e) builds the standard edition again, executables included, so it needs what a release build
needs: Windows, the in-box C# compiler and Python. The tests (tests/test_edition_audit.py) hold
every check to small archives made for the purpose, where each finding can be put in on
purpose and seen to be caught.
