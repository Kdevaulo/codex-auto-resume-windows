<#
    Installer for codex-auto-resume-windows.

    It deploys a self-contained payload: the application and its own Python runtime.
    There is no system Python requirement, no network requirement and no administrator
    requirement, and it registers nothing outside the current user.

    Re-running it is the upgrade and the repair path. Runtime state - settings, pending
    recoveries, retry budgets and logs - lives beside the installation and is never
    touched here; only the program files are replaced.

    An archive of the other edition from the one installed replaces it only when that was
    asked for: -AllowEditionChange, which Install.cmd passes after a y/N answer and the
    bootstrap only after -Edition and -Force. Without it this says what the change would
    keep and change, and stops with 14 before anything is moved.
