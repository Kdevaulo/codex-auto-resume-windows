"""Make the install motion pictures: the setup program's window installing the product, every frame drawn by the

                                                                 # install-update-motion[-ko].png in docs/images/
    python -X utf8 build/make_install_motion.py install-ko       # one of them (a plan's name under build/motion/)
    python -X utf8 build/make_install_motion.py --dry-run        # only the frames each plan asks for, scene by scene
    python -X utf8 build/make_install_motion.py --fidelity       # only the window held to the captured stills
    python -X utf8 build/make_install_motion.py --out DIR        # the pictures into DIR; nothing else is written
    python -X utf8 build/make_install_motion.py --out DIR --client-only   # a proof with no still: the client area

A plan (build/motion/install-en.json, install-ko.json, their scenes and the installer's lines in
install-scenes.json) says, on one clock, what a person does and what the installer prints: the Welcome page of a
first installation, Next, the Options page, Install, the run - each step's line as build/install/install.ps1 prints
it, the bar and the step's name moving on as the window reads them - and the Finish page, its light lit. The update's
(install-update-en.json, install-update-ko.json, install-update-scenes.json) is the same setup program over the
previous final release, installed: its Options page says what it updates from and to and what is new (the version's
section of docs/CHANGELOG[.ko].md, as the setup program reads it from its archive), and its run stops the running
watcher before it copies the new files.

Each frame is drawn by the setup program's own window. build/motion/InstallerRender.cs is compiled TOGETHER with
the sources build/make_setup.py compiles the setup program from - nothing added to them, nothing taken away - into a
scratch program that makes the window as the setup program makes it and drives it through its own doors: its primary
button clicked, its own run started, told the plan's lines one at a time, ended with the code a run that succeeded
ends with. Nothing is installed, unpacked or started. Round each frame's client area go the caption, frame and corners
of one captured still of the real setup window (`window.still`), and over it a pointer and a click's ring of our own
(build/motion_compose.py). The frames are written as a lossless APNG within the plan's byte budget
(build/motion_apng.py), and recorded with what they were made from in assets/install-motion.json.

Before any picture the window is held to the captured stills (FIDELITY: the Welcome page of a first installation,
captured by the main session from the real setup program): the client area drawn offscreen must be the captured one
(build/motion_fidelity.compare). A still that fails stops the run; with no still at all there is no frame to put the
window in, and only `--client-only` draws (a proof, never the documentation's picture).

It captures nothing and moves no pointer: nothing is shown on the screen. It needs Windows (GDI and GDI+), the in-box
C# compiler, and the display at the scale the stills were captured at. Run it from the main session, detached, under
plans/proof/gui_lock.sh like every picture.
