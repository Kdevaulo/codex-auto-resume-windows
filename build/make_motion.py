The README's two show the Dashboard alone, everything outside the window transparent (RGBA); the card's two the
card appearing as the product shows it, on the canvas colour; the logos the icon's own watching motion.

A plan (build/motion_plan.py, build/motion/*.json) says what a person does, scene by scene, on one clock. Each frame
is then drawn:

- the window's client area by the window itself, in its render mode (gui/WindowRender.cs, build/motion_window.py):
  a compiled copy of the working tree's window, never on the screen, answered from the generator's pinned scratch
  installation, put in the frame's page, section, scroll, hover or pressed face, drop-down value or open list, its
  lights at the frame's moment;
- round it, the caption, frame and corners of one captured still (assets/screenshot-dashboard.png) and a drawn
  shadow (build/motion_compose.py);
- under it a plain taskbar strip with the tray icon's own frame at that moment (ui.tray.IconFrames, icon_frame);
- over it the notification card's own paint at that moment of its life (build/motion_card.py);
- over everything a pointer and a click's ring of our own - never the real pointer.

Then identical frames are merged and the frames written as a lossless APNG within the plan's byte budget
(build/motion_apng.py): over the cap nothing is written and the bytes of each scene are printed. Before any picture,
every page the window draws at rest is held to today's committed still (build/motion_fidelity.py) and the result is
recorded, with the picture's inputs, in assets/motion.json; a page that fails stops the run.

It captures nothing and moves no pointer: nothing is shown on the screen. It needs Windows (the window and the card
are drawn with its GDI and GDI+), the in-box C# compiler, and the display at the scale the stills were captured at
(assets/screenshots.json's system_dpi). Run it from the main session after the stills are made, detached, under
plans/proof/quiet.sh like every picture; it takes minutes, most of them the window settling on each page.
