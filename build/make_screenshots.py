"""Render the screenshots the README and the plugin card show.

Both images had drifted three releases behind the product: they showed v0.5.2 while the
manifest said 0.5.4. That was not carelessness, it was the absence of this file. Every
screenshot in the repository was made by hand - build the window, arrange it, run
`capture_window.ps1`, copy the PNG into place - and a step nobody has written down is a
step that gets skipped, especially the fourth time.

So the version in a screenshot now comes from the same place as the version everywhere
else. There is no number in this file and no mock JSON on disk to forget: the window -
its Overview, Pending and Settings pages - is rendered from a scratch installation
assembled out of the working tree, and the panel is rendered from `mcpui` with sample
data whose version field is `config.version()`. Change `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and
re-run this, and every image says the new version without another edit anywhere.

`assets/screenshots.json` records what the images were rendered from. It is not a
signature and it is not checked at runtime - `tests/test_screenshots.py` compares the
recorded input hashes against the working tree and fails when the sources moved and the
images did not. That is the part that could not be done by remembering.

    python build/make_screenshots.py             # every picture whose inputs moved (--all: every one)
    python build/make_screenshots.py --breathe   # then: every captured light that moves, moving
    python build/make_screenshots.py --cards     # only the notification card's pictures
    python build/make_screenshots.py --icon      # only the icon's motion, as a GIF
    python build/make_screenshots.py --light     # only the status light's own picture
    python build/make_screenshots.py --audit OUT # light and dark sheets of all four surfaces, into OUT only

Run it from a checkout, on Windows, with the settings window built, from PowerShell: launched
from a POSIX shell, headless Edge exits at once and prints nothing. A whole regeneration is the
first two lines, in that order. It writes the canonical assets and copies them to `docs/images/`.
The popup and the notification card are drawn off-screen by their own renderers, moving, and need
neither the window nor Edge; the icon's motion is drawn from the icon's own frames and needs nothing
of Windows at all. The window and the panel are captured still, and `--breathe` then draws their
lights moving over the capture (see "pictures that breathe").

Both steps draw their pictures side by side, each job in a process of its own (see "jobs"), and
only what is stale: a picture the manifest says was drawn from what the working tree holds now is
kept as it is. `--all` draws every one; `--jobs N` runs N at a time; `--windows N` lets N of the
window's pictures be captured at once (one unless it says).

Two things it deliberately does NOT do:

* It does not run a watcher. The window shows "watching" when the single-instance mutex
  is held and "checking" while the watcher's heartbeat is fresh, so a helper holds exactly
  that mutex and writes exactly that heartbeat for the length of the capture. A real
  watcher would scan the user's own Codex history and could resume a real conversation,
  which is not a thing a documentation build may do. The records the Dashboard shows are
  synthetic, written into the scratch installation's own store (see `seed_window_state`),
  and the conversation names come from a synthetic Codex home the window is pointed at -
  never from the user's. The compatibility report the Diagnostics page reads is the one the
  watcher's own evaluator writes, made against that home and a stand-in `codex.exe` under the
  scratch installation's own LOCALAPPDATA, which answers the engine checks' two questions and
  is never run (see `seed_compatibility`).
* It does not edit an image. If a screenshot is wrong, the source that produced it is
  wrong.

# What the *window* is rendered from, in two halves.
#
# The compiled half is files, hashed byte for byte (line endings aside): a compiled Windows
# application has no output to look at without running it. Listing is how this went wrong
# the first time - the tuple named seven files and missed five more that visibly change the
# pictures: the title-bar icon, the store fields behind every pending row, the control layer
# that decides what a row carries, the DPI manifest and the capture script itself.
#
# The Python half is not a list of files any more. The window renders no text of its own:
# every label, every value, every row and the whole status line arrive over the bridge as
# JSON, so what the Python side contributes to a picture is exactly what the bridge answers
# the window. `window_envelopes` below asks the bridge the window's own questions, against
# the same kind of scratch installation the capture uses, and the manifest records a hash of
# the answers (`<bridge envelope:{locale}>`). Until v0.6.5 this list held fifteen of the
# package's modules and `tests/codexsim.py` instead, so moving a function between two files
# - the whole of the v0.6.5 modularisation - marked every picture stale and cost a
# re-render on Windows with Edge and a compiled window, while a comment edit in any of them
# did the same. A hash of the answers moves when a word, a row field, a figure, a name or
# the status moves, wherever in the package that is decided, and at no other time.
#
# tests/test_screenshots.py checks both halves: that the C# the window is compiled from is
# on this list, and that each thing the Dashboard's figures, rows and names are computed
# from - the store, the source of the names, the version, the catalogs, the mutex, the Run
# key, the control layer, the state machine, the synthetic Codex home - moves the envelope
# when it changes what it computes.

# and the card's reset is the usage limit's, so the panel, the popup and the card are one moment.
# The window is not: the bridge behind it runs with the real clock, so `render_window` writes the
# same seed, with the same offsets (USAGE_RESET_IN, RETRY_IN), at the moment it is photographed
# and tells the window that moment (CODEX_AR_STILL_NOW). So a countdown, a chip and a count read the

    width, read the height off the root element, and shoot at that.

    Since v0.6.10 the page is asked for its status lights too - every `.halo`, the state's at the top

    draws are the page's, wherever the page puts them, rather than whichever disc of a colour a search
    of the picture found first.

    And at the width the picture is taken at. Edge prints the DOM of a window whose page is 30 px narrower

# comment a reason to re-render - and made moving the renderer into `ui/popup/` and the
# palette into `ui/brand/`, which v0.6.5 does, a `FileNotFoundError` inside `render_inputs`.
#
# It is hashed now as what those modules define. Every top-level definition of every module
# `POPUP_CODE` matches - a function, a class, a constant, a token - is keyed by its name,
# with comments, docstrings and import statements left out, and the modules are pooled. So a
# definition moved from one module to another, with the imports that follow it, hashes the
# same; a changed line of drawing code, a changed token, a new definition or a removed one
# does not. The patterns already cover the two packages the modules are moving into, so the
# day they exist nothing here has to be remembered.
#
# The popup also draws with definitions it imports by name from the rest of the package -
# the icon's countdown, and the Win32 structures and DLL cache the split moves into `win/` -
# and those are pooled too, found by following the import to whichever module holds the
# definition today (`imported_definitions`). So moving one out of the popup's modules into
# `win/dll.py`, or from `tray.py` into it, with the import that brings it back, hashes the
# same as well, without `win/` having to be one of the patterns - which would pool the rest
# of that package, the icon's and the card's structures, into the popup's key.
# `tray_popup.py` and `tray_popup/**` are kept although neither exists: this tuple has
# always named both where a thing is and where it is going, so that the move itself is
# never the change that makes a picture stale.

# ------------------------------------------------------------ the icon's motion
# Since v0.6.5 the notification-area icon moves (tray.py, "the icon's motion"), and the README shows how, as an
# animated GIF. It is drawn here and never by hand: every picture in it is the icon's own frame (tray.IconFrames, with
# nothing on top since v0.6.8, as the icon has nothing), at the moments the icon's own timer shows one
# (tray.icon_frame and icon_frame_ms, stepped as the frame timer steps), laid over a light and a dark taskbar. Five
# states side by side - watching, recovering, needing attention, failed and paused - over a stretch of watching's
# loop that begins two breaths before a sweep and is a whole number of its loops and of recovering's and a failure's
# sweeps and of a failure's 1.2 s blink (`icon_motion_stretch`), so those columns loop without a jump. Attention's
# slow breath does not divide it:
# where the picture starts again that column is within one level of 24 of where it began.
#
# Its manifest entry, `<icon motion>`, is keyed as the card's is: what is pictured (the states, the size, the grounds and the stretch of the loop) and the digest of the code that draws the frames - here the
# definitions the frame table and the schedule are made of, followed name by name from the few the GIF calls
# (ICON_ROOTS) to whatever they use, in whichever module that lives (`icon_drawing`). So a change to the motion, its
# numbers, the mark or its colours marks the GIF stale; a change to the icon's menu or popup does not.

# --------------------------------------------------------- pictures that breathe
# A still picture of a light says nothing about a light that moves, so every picture of a surface whose light moves
# is animated (v0.6.9), and since v0.6.10 every light in it moves as the product moves it (F15). Until then one disc
# a picture was found by its colour and painted again, on the light theme's `surface` whatever it stood on, in
# monitoring's rhythm, 132 frames of 33 ms - 4356 ms against the product's 4400: the panel's tile light held still
# beside the one above it, a light on a tile or in the dark theme would have been painted in a box of the wrong
# ground, and every picture ran 1% fast.
#
# Now each surface declares its lights (`picture_record`): where each one is, its radius, its state and the ground
# it stands on. The popup and the card declare the halo their own layout places, and are drawn moving by their own
# renderers where they are made (`render_popup`, `render_card`). The panel is asked where its lights are
# (`panel_probe`) and the window, which cannot be asked, is searched for discs of its light's colour
# (`find_lights`), as many as it has (WINDOW_LIGHTS); both are captured still at the first moment of the breath, and
# `--breathe` draws each light they declare again over the capture at every moment of one cycle, with its own
# radius, ground and state (`paint_light`), the checking arc included - after holding the capture to what was
# declared (`check_capture`). A viewer that ignores the animation sees the first frame.
#
# One cycle exactly (`light_timeline`): the lights that move in a picture move on one rhythm - a picture whose lights
# have two is refused - at BREATHE_FPS, and a frame's delay is written as the exact fraction of a second it is, so a
# 4400 ms breath takes 4400 ms. A picture with two lights (the panel) draws one of them a frame, each in its turn:
# an APNG frame is one rectangle, and one rectangle round two lights 1170 px apart is most of the page, every frame.

# The window's Python half, as the window receives it (see WINDOW_INPUTS).
#
# `window_envelopes` builds the installation `render_window` builds (`pinned_installation`) -
# the stored settings in the pinned theme, the Dashboard's records written by the product's
# own store, the synthetic Codex home the names come from, the compatibility report the
# watcher's evaluator writes for it, the watcher's mutex held and its heartbeat written,
# recovery switched on through the bridge - and asks the bridge, through the same `serve` loop
# the window keeps open, what the window asks to draw the photographed pages.
# The canonical text of the answers is the envelope; its hash is the manifest entry.
# The wire goldens (`tests/wiregolden.py`) ask every other command of the same installation.
#
# It has to come out the same on every machine and every run, and the answers carry four
# things that would not. Each is pinned or rewritten, never dropped, so the envelope still
# moves when the thing itself does:
#
# * the clock. The records are seeded at ENVELOPE_NOW and the bridge answers with `time.time`
#   reading ENVELOPE_NOW, so every countdown, age, "checking" and the week the Statistics
#   figures cover come out the same; the compatibility report is checked forty seconds
#   before it, and the engine file it is bound to dated six days before. A clock time
#   formatted for a person is formatted in UTC rather than the machine's zone;
# * paths. The scratch installation, the checkout, the temporary directory and the user's
#   profile are rewritten to `<scratch>`, `<checkout>`, `<temp>` and `<profile>` wherever
#   they appear in an answer, in every spelling (resolved or not, either slash, any case);
# * the process id. The capture's mutex holder writes its own into the heartbeat; the
#   envelope writes ENVELOPE_PID;
# * the machine. The language is the locale being rendered, set the way the generator sets
#   it for every surface; the Run key and the notification registration read as they read
#   for any scratch installation, "nothing registered", from a stand-in that refuses every
#   write; CODEX_HOME points at the synthetic home and LOCALAPPDATA at the scratch
#   installation's own, where the stand-in Codex engine is, so the engine the report
#   describes is found - and no other; the product's own overrides (CODEX_AUTO_RESUME_HOME,
#   CODEX_AUTO_RESUME_CODEX_EXE) are unset. The report itself reaches the window as the
#   reader's view, which carries no path: the digest of the engine's path and the engine's
#   size and time bind the report on disk and are never part of an answer.

# the look needs both: the four surfaces side by side in each theme, and the same sheet from before a
# change beside the one from after it.

# So this draws, in each theme, the window's Overview and Pending pages, the top of the panel, the
# popup and the notification card - from the one fixture the published pictures use (`fixture`: the
# panel, the popup and the card at POPUP_NOW, the window at its capture's own moment with the same
# offsets, so relative times agree and wall-clock times need not), every surface at the scale the
# window is captured at, so one CSS pixel is the same size in all four - and lays them out, each at
# its own pixel size, on one contact sheet per theme.
# Given `--before`, a folder an earlier `--audit` wrote, it adds a sheet per theme of each surface
# before and after.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------ jobs
# A whole run is a set of jobs, drawn side by side (v0.6.11).
#
# Until then everything was drawn one after another - about twenty-five window pictures at a fixed
# fifteen seconds each, then the panels, the popups, the cards and the motions - which took a
# quarter of an hour on a busy machine. A job is the pictures one call draws together: one locale's
# window pages, from their one scratch installation, one panel, one popup, one locale's cards, the
# icon's motion or the light's. Each runs in a process of its own, `python build/make_screenshots.py
# --job ...`, with the language set as the run one after another set it by then and the process
# aware of the display's scaling, as `window_record` had made that run's before anything was drawn
# in it. So what one job patches for the length of a call - the clock, the environment, the modules
# a compatibility report is made with - no other job can see, and each picture is drawn by exactly
# the code, in exactly the state, it was drawn in before. The windows may be captured side by side too,
# WINDOWS_AT_ONCE at a time on the whole machine (`--windows N`; one unless it says): each language has its
# installation, PrintWindow draws a window another one covers, and build/capture_window.ps1 takes the moment
# of capture one at a time.
#
# And only what is stale is drawn (`stale`). A job whose inputs are, in the manifest, what the
# working tree gives now, whose pictures are the bytes the manifest records, with their lights, and
# - for the window - whose pictures were captured at this machine's scaling, is kept as it is. The
# generator is an input of every job, so a change to this file draws everything, as `--all` does.
