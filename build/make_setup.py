"""The one-file installers: CodexAutoResume-Setup-v<version>.exe and CodexAutoResume-Advanced-Setup-v<version>.exe.

    python build/make_setup.py [--edition standard|advanced] [--dist build/dist]
    python build/make_setup.py --check [--edition ...] [--dist ...]

Each is build/setup/Setup.cs compiled around its edition's release archive: the ZIP's bytes, exactly as
build/make_release.py wrote them, as the program's one managed resource, and their SHA-256 as a constant
beside it. Double-clicked, it checks those bytes, unpacks them into a new folder of its own in the user's
temporary folder, runs that archive's own Install.cmd there and removes the folder afterwards - so it installs
what the ZIP installs, asking what the ZIP's Install.cmd asks, and ends with its exit code. make_release.py
builds it right after the archive, from the very file it wrote, and writes a .sha256 beside it as it does for
the archive.

Double-clicked, it is a window (v0.6.16): the product's installer window, gui/InstallerWindow.cs and
gui/InstallerFlow.cs, drawn with the settings window's own controls in its palette - the [installer], [controls] and
[generated] groups of gui/window.sources, and gui/WindowJson.cs for the catalogs it reads - beside
build/setup/SetupWindow.cs, which gives the window what a setup program has. So it is a Windows program, not a
console one: with -Silent it shows nothing and asks nothing, as before.

It is compiled the way build/make_gui.ps1 compiles the settings window: by the in-box C# compiler of .NET
Framework 4.8, which every supported Windows has, for x64, with the product's icon and a version resource made
from .codex-plugin/plugin.json, and then build/normalize_pe.py fixes the two fields the compiler stamps anew
each run - so the same archive always gives the same bytes, and anyone can rebuild a published setup program
from the published archive and compare. `--check` does that to what is in the dist folder: builds it again,
compares, and holds the carried archive to the one beside it byte for byte. The manifest is embedded with CRLF
line endings whatever the checkout wrote, since its bytes are part of the program's.

The archive goes in unchanged, so the ZIP, its name and every published bootstrap that takes it are exactly
what they were; this is one more file beside them.
