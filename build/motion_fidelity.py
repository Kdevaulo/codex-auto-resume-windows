"""Whether the window the motion picture is drawn from is the window the captured pictures show (TOOLING section 4).

Each page drawn at rest by the render mode - no hover, no pointer, its lights at the still's moment - is held to that
page's committed still (assets/screenshot-<page>[-<locale>].png), client area only:

- at least MIN_EXACT of its pixels exactly the still's;
- every pixel that is not within TEXT_LEVELS levels a channel and within TEXT_REACH px of glyph ink in the still - a
  ClearType edge drawn into a memory bitmap instead of on the screen - and none in a fill, a border or a shadow.

Two kinds of pixel are left out, and why is recorded with the result: the corners Windows rounds, which the capture
leaves clear (the motion lays them from the still, motion_compose.WindowChrome); and the status light, which the
pictures' `--breathe` step paints again over every capture with the generator's own drawing (make_screenshots.
paint_light), where the motion shows the window's own light at each moment - its difference is measured and recorded,
not held. The card's resting frame is held byte for byte to the README card (tests/test_motion_card.py does that).
