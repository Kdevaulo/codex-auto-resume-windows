"""The frame plan of a rendered motion picture: scenes of pinned states, read from a file, expanded to frames.

A motion picture of the product (plans/v0616-readme/APNG-storyboard.md) is never filmed: every frame is drawn by the
product's own code on a pinned clock, from synthetic data, and the pointer is drawn onto it afterwards. What is drawn
when is written down here, as a plan file under build/motion/, scene by scene, and nothing about the motion is decided
anywhere else - the window's render mode (gui/WindowRender.cs) is told a state per frame and draws it, the card is
told a moment, and the compositor is told where the pointer stands.

A plan is JSON:

    {"format": "car-motion/1", "name": "readme-en", "output": "docs/images/readme-motion.png",
     "scenes_from": "readme-scenes.json", "values": {"first": "en", "second": "ko"},
     "light_step_ms": 33, "length": [25000, 35000], "budget": {"cap": 9000000},
     ...the canvas, the window, the taskbar and the card (make_motion.py reads those)...}

`scenes` (or the file `scenes_from` names, beside it) is a list of {"id", "steps"}. A `${name}` anywhere in the scenes
is replaced by `values[name]`, so one storyboard serves both READMEs. Each step starts where the one before ended:

    {"hold": ms}                                   nothing changes; only the lights move
    {"set": {...}, "hold": ms}                     a cut: the window's state changes at once
    {"move": target, "frames": n, "step": ms}      the pointer travels to `target`, eased (brand.ease)
    {"hover": target, "frames": n, "step": ms}     the target shows its hover face
    {"press": target, "frames": n, "step": ms}     ...its pressed face, and a ripple where the pointer is
    {"card": "enter" | "shown" | "leave", "frames": n, "step": ms}   ("shown": already at rest)
    {"wheel": notches, "frames": n, "step": ms}    the page scrolls as SoftPage glides it
    {"open": "setting.<field>", "frames": n, "step": ms, "hold": ms}   the field's drop list fades in, then holds
    {"rows": [value, ...], "step": ms}             the pointer's row in the open list, one after another
    {"choose": value, "hold": ms}                  the list closes with `value` shown (not saved)
    {"right": "task.<n>", "frames": n, "step": ms, "hold": ms}   a right click on a Pending row: it is chosen, a
                                                   ripple where the pointer is, and the row's own menu opens there
    {"dismiss": "menu", "hold": ms}                the menu closes with nothing chosen (Escape)

A target is a name the window answers with bounds (`page.<name>`, `section.<name>`, `save`, `setting.<field>`,
`row.<value>` in an open drop list, `task.<n>` - the Pending list's row n - and `menu.<n>` - item n of the open row
menu, which a hover in it names), a button of the card (`card.<target>`), `{"at": [x, y]}` on the canvas, or
`{"by": [dx, dy]}` from where the pointer is. Window states use the keys `STATE_KEYS`; the render mode refuses any
other. Every frame is a moment `t` in ms from the start, and everything that moves by itself - the window's lights,
the card's light, the tray icon - is drawn at that moment, so a plan only says what a person does.
