"""Extract one version's section from docs/CHANGELOG.md, for the GitHub release body.

The changelog is the only place release notes are written, so the published notes cannot
drift from the repository's own history: there is nothing to keep in step.

It fails rather than inventing anything. A tag whose version has no changelog section is
a mistake worth stopping the release for, not something to paper over with a generated
list of commit subjects.

The changelog lives in docs/ since the front page was tidied, and its relative links are
written from there (`GUIDE.md`, `../README.md`). A release body is not in docs/: GitHub
resolves a relative link in it from the repository's root. So each relative link is rebased
to the root on the way out - left as written, every link in every release body from then on
would have pointed one folder too high.
