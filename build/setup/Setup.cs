// CodexAutoResume-Setup-v<version>.exe, and the advanced edition's CodexAutoResume-Advanced-Setup-v<version>.exe:
// the release's ZIP in one file that installs when it is double-clicked, with nothing to unzip first.
//
// It carries one thing, its edition's release archive, byte for byte, as a managed resource, with the archive's
// SHA-256 as a constant beside it (build/make_setup.py compiles both in). When it starts it
//   1. takes DLLs from System32 alone, or stops. It is downloaded and started from Downloads, where anything
//      else downloaded lies too, and Windows looks for a DLL that is not one of its KnownDLLs in a program's own
//      folder first: codex-compat-reporter 1.4.0 loaded bcrypt, CRYPTSP, CRYPTBASE and profapi from there;
//   2. stops when a <program>.config is beside it. .NET reads one before Main, and this program never comes
//      with one, so it is someone else's file;
//   3. checks the carried bytes against the constant, and stops on any difference;
//   4. makes a folder of its own in the user's temporary folder - a new name, created new, refused when it is
//      already there, a junction included, and held open so it cannot be swapped while it is used - and unpacks
//      the archive into it, refusing any entry that would land anywhere else. A long temporary folder does not
//      stop it: the files are written by their \\?\ names, which have no 260-character limit;
//   5. runs that archive's own Install.cmd by its full path, in that folder, with the arguments given here passed
//      on, and with no window of its own (CREATE_NO_WINDOW): what it prints is passed on to this program's own
//      output, byte for byte, or read line by line by the window below;
//   6. removes the folder, and ends with Install.cmd's exit code.
// Double-clicked it is a window (v0.6.16, SetupWindow, gui/InstallerWindow.cs): the product's own installer
// window, which says what it installs, asks what Install.cmd would ask - and only that - and shows how far
// install.ps1 is from the lines it prints, then whether it finished and with which code, and its log. It is a
// Windows program, so no console window opens at all; the window answers for Install.cmd, which it runs with
// -Silent. With -Silent on its own command line (winget, a script) there is no window and nothing is asked:
// it does what it did before v0.6.16, and ends with the same exit codes.
// No network, no administrator rights (its manifest asks for none) and no Python of its own: the archive
// carries the Python the installer uses.
//
// The digest shows the carried bytes are the ones the build put in, so a damaged download or disk is caught -
// not who made them: whoever could change the archive could change the constant too. Who made them is what the
// release's build provenance attestation says (docs/VERIFY.md).
//
// Two hooks, for tests/test_setup.py, and neither starts anything: --loaded-modules does steps 1 to 4 and 6 and
// prints, as a JSON array, the path of every module this process has loaded; --unpack-into <name> does steps 1
// to 4 into <name> in the temporary folder rather than a new name, then 6 - how the tests hold the refusal of a
// folder that is already there.
//
// Its own messages are in English, as Install.cmd's and the installer's are: it runs before anything of the
// product is on the machine. The window speaks the product's languages, from the catalogs in the archive it
// carries.
//
// C# 5 only: this is compiled by the in-box csc (build/make_setup.py).
