# Changelog

## v0.6.18 — A recovery that worked is recovered however its turn ended, a suggestion for the Codex homes this PC uses, Install another version in the setup window, a setup bar that fills by real counts, a streamed update download, and the fixes of a full audit

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.17...v0.6.18)

**From v0.6.17, an ordinary update.** It is the latest release, for both editions, so v0.6.17's *Check for updates*
offers it in the edition you have, and the plugin in Codex installs it too. It has no pre-release of its own: it is
v0.6.17 with the changes below. Both editions change in the first group; the second is the advanced edition's alone,
and what it changes is off until you turn it on. What this release does not carry - the rest of the advanced
edition's last stage, which the roadmap had planned for v0.6.18 - is v0.6.19 now.

**Going back.** The advanced edition's own file stays version 7, as in v0.6.17, and the file's mark of the oldest
version that reads it is unchanged. The watcher's state stays schema 5 and now also carries a readable-from mark, as
the advanced edition's file has since v0.6.17: it says that a reader from schema 5 on may use the state. The mark is
written once - when the state is created, when it is upgraded, or when this version first opens a schema-5 state that
has none - and the schema does not change with it, so v0.6.17 and v0.6.16 open a marked file as their own, as they
open any schema-5 state, and read no mark. What it is for comes later: a future release that adds only a table, or a
column at the end of a table, can keep the mark, and this version then uses that newer state as it is - every table it
knows holding at least its columns, nothing upgraded - instead of refusing it as newer. A state marked newer than the
reader, marked by another schema than the one it holds, or not marked is refused with the words it always was.
*Install another version...* keeps the state for a target that reads the mark - v0.6.18 on - exactly as it keeps it
for a target on this schema; today both rules give the same rows, and the schemas 4 and 3 are still converted first.
The state conversion that *Install another version...* makes for an older target takes the mark off. Going back to v0.6.17 or v0.6.16 keeps every
advanced feature on there, as it was. The weekly update check keeps three numbers in the advanced file's table of
choices - when it last ran, the newest version it offered, and when - beside the choices themselves. No feature
offers them as a choice, and v0.6.17 and v0.6.16 pass over a row they do not know, as every reader of that table
always did, so going back loses nothing and shows nothing of them. The settings file gains two keys of the Codex homes
suggestion (below), on by default and the folders set aside; v0.6.17 and v0.6.16 do not know them and drop them the next
time they save the file, so going back loses nothing but the folders you set aside with *Not now*, which are suggested
again if you come forward. Nothing else was added to either file.

### Both editions

- **A Codex home this PC uses and the watcher does not watch is suggested.** This is the release's improvement to the
  standard edition. The Codex homes card in Settings > Advanced now says *Codex also uses <folder>. Watch it too?* with
  **Add** and **Not now**. Add puts the folder among the extra Codex homes through the one way a home is added, so the
  limit of three still holds, and with all three taken the line says so instead of offering; **Not now** remembers the
  folder and never offers it again. A switch, *Suggest Codex homes found on this PC*, is on by default and turns the
  looking off; nothing is added until you choose Add. It looks in two places only, and reads them without writing:
  the `CODEX_HOME` variable of your Windows account (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment`), and the Codex app's own list of
  where it has run (`chrome-native-hosts-v2.json`, which it writes for its browser extension), at most 1 MiB of it, of
  which only each entry's `codexHome` is kept. A folder is offered only if it is a local folder holding Codex's state
  database that is not the default home and not already added. It looks only in an installed copy, never in a
  checkout; nothing is sent anywhere and nothing is told to Codex; the diagnostics count the folders you set aside and
  name none. The standard B16, which lists every registry read, names the `CODEX_HOME` one, marked as extended for this
  suggestion at the owner's request; the guide's *Several Codex homes* and the privacy notice say where it looks and
  what is kept. Its words are in all 18 languages.
- **A recovery turn that worked and was then cut off is recovered.** Codex writes a turn's end only while the turn is
  running, so a recovery turn that Codex closing, or the PC sleeping or restarting, interrupted said it was in progress
  for good. Such a turn is now taken to be cut off as soon as a later turn of the same conversation has started - Codex
  runs one turn at a time - or as soon as Windows has started since the turn began, and it is judged as a failed turn
  is: one that made progress is **recovered**, with the reason `progress_then_turn_cut_off`, which keeps that the turn
  itself did not end cleanly; one that did nothing stays unverified, as it did. Before, the record showed the turn as
  running until a later turn of the conversation finished or a day had passed, and then called it unverified however
  much it had done. A message you write in the conversation before the turn has done anything still hands it over
  first (see the next item for one that comes after), a turn that is really running still shows as running, and a
  history that cannot be read never counts as "no progress". The owner amended standard E6 for it on 2026-10-21; two
  recoveries on the owner's own PC were the report.
- **A recovery turn that worked before you joined it is recovered, and its next failure is recovered too.** When a
  message of yours entered the recovery turn after that turn had made progress - one you had queued in the Codex app,
  or the answer to a question Codex asked you inside the turn - the conversation used to be handed over to you on sight
  of the message. If the turn then hit the usage limit, that failure was born superseded and never resumed, although
  the limit had stopped you as well. Now the record ends **recovered**, with the reason `progress_then_user_joined`,
  and the turn's next failure is an ordinary chain child that is recovered in its turn. A message that enters the turn
  before it made any progress hands the conversation over as before, and standard A23 still keeps that child stopped.
  The owner amended A23 and five of the frozen scenarios for it on 2026-10-22; two cases on the owner's own PC were the
  report - a queued message that entered a recovery turn 52 minutes after it started, and an answer given to a question
  in the recovery turn that then hit the limit at once.
- **A conversation you took over, or whose recovery you cancelled, is told in those words.** A new failure of a
  conversation whose recovery turn you joined before it did anything, or of a task whose automatic recovery was
  cancelled, is rightly never resumed - but it was announced with the words of a recovery that ran out of retries ("stopped
  trying"). The notice now names the conversation, the new failure's reason and why nothing will be sent ("You are
  continuing this conversation yourself, so it will not be resumed automatically", "Automatic recovery was cancelled
  for this task, ..."), in all 18 languages; the card shows the reason in its chip. It is still a "stopped" notice, under
  the same switch, without a button. The notices of a recovery that did run out of retries keep their words. The
  owner's notice of 2026-10-22 was the report.
- **The notification-area icon moves in the overflow flyout while the flyout is open.** Windows can keep the watcher's
  icon in the overflow flyout, and since v0.6.5 it was held still there, open or closed, because nobody would see it
  move; but a person looks at it by opening the flyout. The icon now moves from the tick after the flyout opens until
  the tick after it closes, and is held still as before while the flyout is closed. The check asks Windows only for the
  class of each top-level window and whether it is shown and not cloaked, never what is in it, and it looks at the
  overflow window of every taskbar, so a taskbar on a second screen with its flyout closed no longer hides one that is
  open. Reduce motion, Windows' own animation setting, High Contrast, battery saver and a locked session hold the icon
  still as before, and nothing drawn changes: the frames, rates and colours are the same. Standard H13 says so. The
  owner's report was that the icon seemed still again.
- **The setup window's bar fills by real, counted work.** The setup program shows it, and so does an update or an
  uninstall started from the Dashboard or from Settings. The installer now counts the files it copies, the files and
  folders it removes and the plugin's three commands to Codex; setup counts its own seven steps and the health check
  its eight checks. Each says how far it has got on a line of its own, which the window reads and keeps out of the log
  it shows. The bar glides on up to the share of the work that is done and stops there, never past it, and reaches
  100% only after a run that ended well. It does not move while a picture is being taken or while the window is out of
  sight, and with motion reduced it jumps instead of gliding. A window that gets no such line - an older installer
  behind it, say - reads the installer as before. The lines are asked for by the window alone: every other caller of
  the installer, the setup step and the health check - `Install.cmd`'s console, a log, the watcher the setup starts -
  gets exactly the output it always did.
- **The update's archive is streamed, and every step of the download is checked.** The release archive and its
  `.sha256` come in through a request that reads the body 64 KB at a time into a file of its own beside the target.
  The file is moved into place only when it is whole, so no partial archive is left behind after any failure.
  Each redirect is followed by hand, at most five, and every address it names is held to the update's own rule - https,
  and one of the hosts the update is allowed to ask - and to the same words when it is refused, *before* it is asked;
  the answer's status and address are checked before a single byte is written. A body that stops short of the length
  the server announced is named as cut short, and a dropped connection is resumed from where it stopped, at most
  twice, and only on an answer that continues exactly there; a failed resume says what it got, so a GitHub rate limit
  is still named as one. Where the server says how long the archive is, the real bytes received go to the setup
  window's bar, once per whole percent. Everything else is as it was: the same words and exit codes, the system proxy,
  the same user agent and 300-second limit, TLS as the system sets it, and the digest check after the download.
  **The download is done by the updater of the version you are updating from**, so this takes effect from the update
  after this one: the update to v0.6.18 still downloads as v0.6.17's updater does, and the bar shows the bytes from
  the update after it.
- **The README's and the guide's install picture shows the bar filling by those counts**, in English and Korean. The
  README's first motion picture now also right-clicks a waiting task on the Pending page and opens its menu, as the
  window draws it, before it goes on to History.
- **Install another version... runs in the setup window.** The Dashboard's picker used to run the installer with no
  window of its own. It now opens the same window an update does, headed *Installing another version* and finished
  with *Installed v...*, with the download and the installer's steps on its bar as they happen, and the finished page
  with its exit code and the log. It has no *What is new* page, because the picker's installer prints no notes. What
  the installer printed still reaches the same answers it always did, and when the pick installed and you open the new
  Dashboard, the Dashboard that was running closes, as after an update, saying first what the state conversion did.
- **The setup window's steps no longer show one label twice.** The step before the copy - finding Codex, claiming the
  folder, setting the old program files aside - is named *Preparing the program files*, so *Copying the program files*
  shows once, for the copy alone; the watcher's and the Dashboard's steps no longer sit between two of the same name.
- **The right-click menu of a Pending row is drawn in the product's own design.** It is a rounded card with the
  window's shadow and hairline, the item in hand a raised pill, the palette's colours, the window's font and its scale
  (100% to 200%), and submenus open beside their parent's card. In High Contrast the menu stays Windows' own. The items,
  their words, their order and what they do are unchanged. The README's first motion picture shows it: a right-click
  on a waiting task opens that menu.
- **Fixes from an audit of the Dashboard window.**
  - The Dashboard never hangs on a stuck call to the program behind it. A call reads the program's output and errors
    together, gives up after 60 seconds (180 for a one-shot call), and ends only the child processes it started,
    never the watcher; closing the window ends every one-shot child on its way out. A bridge the window gave up on is
    tried again after five minutes.
  - The window no longer waits for its words: it opens in English after five seconds without them and opens again in
    its own language when they arrive.
  - The window is drawn at the scale of the monitor it opens on, and redrawn at the next monitor's scale after Windows
    reports a scale change - once a drag ends, and never while you have unsaved edits.
  - The window is kept on, and centred on, the screen it opens on rather than the primary one, and a width it holds
    never makes it larger than the screen (on a small screen at 200% or more it used to grow past the work area).
  - The log dialog skips its five-second look while a look is still on its way.
  - The setup window's bar is announced to screen readers: its percent and its description tell assistive technology
    when they change.
- **Fixes from an audit of the control layer.**
  - Words for this time that you write, change or take away while the watcher is already sending a recovery are now
    either sent or kept, never deleted unsent: the watcher looks at them again after it claims the recovery and gives
    the claim back if they changed, and the Dashboard checks that the recovery still waits under the same lock.
  - *Always* and *Never* for a project read each record's project in the Codex home that holds it. A row of a home you
    added in Settings was refused as unreadable, and *Never* on a row of the default home left the waiting records of
    the same project in an added home unheld.
  - A stale notice's *Cancel* on a recovery that has finished since no longer says it was cancelled: the card answers
    that it had already finished and Windows' notification logs the truth, and neither announces anything. The
    notification's *Cancel* also tries again for 30 seconds when the state is busy, as a card's does, where a lock held
    past the store's own wait used to end its windowless process in an error nobody saw.
  - The plugin's MCP replies carry no path of the Codex program: `get_status`, `open_settings` and `update_settings`
    say only whether one is set (`<set>`, or none), as the diagnostics do, because the path may hold your Windows user
    name and these replies go on to Codex. The MCP server also answers only an unknown tool or resource as an invalid
    request; a lookup that breaks inside is an internal error and no longer goes out as the caller's mistake in its raw
    text. Standard D7 says so.
  - The *Open Codex* flag of a *Cancel* link is honoured only where the edition offers that button, never in the
    standard edition: a crafted `codex-auto-resume:` cancel link made a standard installation's follow-up notice offer
    the advanced edition's button, against A28.
- **Fixes from an audit of the core.**
  - A settings file that cannot be read right now is never taken as the defaults. The watcher keeps the settings in
    force, reads the file again at the next tick and says so once in its log; with no good read yet it builds no
    engine, so nothing is sent or cancelled. A save refuses rather than write the defaults over a file it could not
    read (a file that holds no settings is still repaired), and *Restore defaults* keeps the Codex homes only through
    a good read.
  - A recovery message that starts with a dash - a Custom message, a queued prompt or a chat message like "- keep
    going" or "-1 more step" - reaches `codex queue` as the message. It was read as an unknown option, Codex exited
    with an error, and the record became "submission unknown" and was never sent again; the message now goes as one
    `--message=` argument.
  - Every write that cancels a record gives it its outcome time, so cancelled and superseded records are ordered and
    aged as the others are.
  - A Codex home whose folder is on a mapped network drive is not retired when the drive's name changes between its
    online and offline forms, and the start's sweep of records no Settings home names waits while a named folder is
    out of reach, so neither cancels that home's waiting records.
  - A clock set back by hand or by a time-server step ends the cached usage reading and the cached loaded state, which
    were kept for the whole step back.
  - A queue delete that worked stays reported as worked when the Codex app server is slow to exit afterwards; it used
    to turn into a failure and leave a Pause or Observe-only withdrawal that could never be released.
  - The engine check reads a `codex --version` that is not UTF-8 instead of raising.
  - While the default home's engine is being rebuilt - during a Codex update, say - and another home has something
    queued, the one-second watch no longer writes a "watch failed" traceback every second; it watches the other homes
    until the engine is back.
- **Fixes from an audit of the installer and the update.**
  - A line that setup writes to stderr no longer stops the installer half way when it runs outside another app: setup's
    exit code decides, as it does inside one. `verify-home` and `claim-home` likewise answer with their exit code, so a
    line on stderr no longer replaces their refusal with a raw error.
  - An update that is put back, or that stops before its setup, starts again the watcher it stopped, and a failed
    setup says when that watcher is not running.
  - A failed *Install another version...* puts back what it changed while the previous version is still installed: the
    state it converted (from the copy the conversion took), the kept uninstaller and with it the entry in Settings >
    Apps, and the watcher.
  - An uninstall that cannot remove a program file keeps the runtime and what its verification runs, so the retry can
    finish; it used to delete the runtime anyway and leave the retry stuck at "No installed runtime found". A purge
    says it removed the settings and recovery history only when it did, and names what something still held, and the
    uninstall's sweep of its leftovers no longer prints a bare `True` or `False` into its log.
  - A bracket in the installation's folder or in an archive's path is a character, not a wildcard, so an update there
    moves the old files aside as everywhere else. A rollback that cannot clear the half-copied tree leaves the
    previous one aside under its own name, never inside it, and says it could not put everything back. A Dashboard
    program that cannot be replaced is said, and the update goes on to set up the watcher instead of ending there.
  - The installer's calls to `codex` run with telemetry off, with the same variable and overrides as the watcher's
    own (standard C10).
  - An installation folder outside your profile (the plugin home variable) is made private to you - you, SYSTEM and
    Administrators, full control, nothing inherited - before the program goes into it, because a folder under a drive
    root inherits `Authenticated Users: Modify` and other accounts on the PC could replace the launcher, the program
    or the runtime that run as you at each sign-in. Where the drive keeps no access list, or it cannot be written, the
    installer says so and goes on. A path holding a curly single quote is a path and never code: the gate doubles
    every single-quote character PowerShell knows. The compatibility data's download checks every redirect before it
    is asked and writes no more than one byte past its bound, as the archive's download does.
- **Fixes from the security audit and a bug hunt.**
  - A named object another account made first is refused. The watcher's mutex and its stop, wake and demo events have
    names anyone can work out; the check refused one made by a process of lower integrity, but a process of another
    account at the same integrity - the sandbox account Codex runs commands under, say - could still create one first
    with a permissive access list and then hold it or signal it. An existing one is now refused too when its owner is
    neither this account, the administrators nor SYSTEM.
  - The Dashboard ignores a close-for-update event that someone else made first. An update asks the Dashboard's
    windows to close through a named event; one created and set first by a low-integrity process or another account
    closed every Dashboard as it opened. The Dashboard now refuses an event that existed before it under the same rule
    as above.
  - A compatibility document that runs more than 100 sequences ahead of the data the release bundles is refused. Any
    number up to 2^31-1 was taken in, so one imported file, or one mistaken document, at the top number refused every
    later document as a rollback - the project's own refreshes and the data of every release - and its
    *incompatible* entries kept the gate there for good. One kept from before is now not in force and blocks no later
    import.
  - The watcher sweeps what an update set aside and could not delete, as it starts. An update moves the old program,
    runtime and Dashboard files aside as `.old-` folders and deletes them after the copy unless something still had
    them open; about 14 MB each stayed in the home until the next install. The watcher now removes them once it holds
    its mutex - only in an installation folder provably its own, never while an install is running or its copy journal
    is there, never through a link, renaming a folder first so one still in use is never half deleted - and writes one
    log line saying what it removed and what it left.
- **A state that is marked readable from schema 5** (see *Going back* above) is used by a later schema that so marks
  itself instead of being refused, and the version picker keeps it for a target that reads the mark.
- **All 17 translations were reviewed** against the English in both catalogs, the standard's and the advanced
  edition's: Korean, Japanese, Simplified and Traditional Chinese, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Brazilian
  Portuguese, Russian, Ukrainian, Polish, Turkish, Arabic, Hebrew, Vietnamese and Indonesian. Each now says one word for each thing - for example the
  watcher, the continuation, a turn, the recovery, the edition's own name and, in Korean, the usage limit and its
  reset, are one term each across both catalogs - and keeps the formal or informal address its language uses
  (Traditional Chinese addresses you as 您 in both catalogs; German keeps *Sie*, and Spanish and Italian the
  informal *tú* and *tu*, throughout). A usage window is no longer worded as an application window in the Asian languages, the word for
  "change the edition" no longer reads as changing the version, a few sentences that claimed more than the English
  (that a long conversation is "the usual cause") were corrected, and broken text - stray spaces inside words, split
  measurement ids, wrong particles and genders - was made consistent. The advanced-edition statements (goal
  continuation, continuation with no marker, start with Codex) that were still in English in Arabic and in Hebrew are
  translated, and both languages, which are held back until the Dashboard mirrors right to left but ship, were read
  string by string. The English is unchanged. The Korean usage-limit notice now says the usage is reset (재설정), as
  every other Korean string does. The Russian *Retry now* button now reads "Повторить сейчас", a verb like the English, and
  the two strings that quote it follow (suggested by [@TheEleage](https://github.com/TheEleage), in a review of the
  Russian labels in their fork).
- **The Korean documents were reviewed page by page against the English.** Every Korean page now names the versions
  its English page names, follows its English page again where it had drifted, and uses the Korean interface's own
  words (워처, 사전 릴리스, 공개, 재설정, 설치 마법사 for the setup program and 설치 프로그램 for the installer).
- **The documents say what the code does now.** A full review of the README, the guide, the privacy, security, support,
  plugin, editions, verify, brand, comparison, contributing and contributors pages, the feature matrix, the roadmap and
  this changelog against the code corrected their counts and lists - the plugin's twenty tools, the advanced edition's
  thirty-two capabilities, each catalog and window input, the processes and requests a click starts - and added the
  setup window's bar, the streamed download, *Open Codex* and the weekly check where they were missing; the guide leads
  with the setup program as the README does. At the owner's word on 2026-10-22, standards D7 (MCP replies carry only
  whether a Codex program path is set), H13 (motion stops in a closed overflow flyout) and A23 were reworded, the
  contributors page says that commits written with Claude carry a `Co-Authored-By` trailer naming the model, and the
  contributing page now tells an alpha from a beta by whether it carries something a person can notice: an alpha
  nothing a person can notice, a beta something they can. Standards B6, B16, C5 and F6 were corrected to match the code
  and say they were corrected, not amended by the owner.

### Advanced edition

- **Open Codex on a notice.** While it is on, and where Windows has a handler for `codex:` links, every notice about
  one conversation - a usage limit detected, a continuation being sent, how one ended - offers *Open Codex* beside
  *Open Dashboard*, on the program's card and on Windows' own notification alike. A click shows that conversation in
  the Codex app through Codex's own link to it: a running or minimized app comes to the front at that conversation,
  and a closed one starts there (measured on Codex app 26.1007). Whether Windows has a handler for `codex:` is read,
  never written. A notice about no one conversation - a warning near a limit, the memory guard, the power action -
  never has the button, and the notice shown after you cancel a recovery from Windows' notification offers it exactly
  where the notice you pressed offered it. Nothing is sent to Codex and nothing in the conversation changes. It
  departs from standards A28, B16 and F6, which the page where you turn it on says.
- **A weekly update check while idle.** While it is on, the watcher runs the Dashboard's own *Check for updates* - the
  installed copy's bootstrap script with `-CheckOnly`, no window, two minutes at most - at most once in seven days, and
  only while nothing is waiting, being sent or being watched and recovery is not paused; where the update check is
  turned off by policy it makes none. A newer release - or a newer pre-release, where a check you start would offer
  one - appears as one notification, *A newer version is available*, a kind of its own in *Keep on screen until
  clicked*, whose *Open Dashboard* button opens Diagnostics, where you install it as always. Nothing is downloaded or
  installed by it. The time of the last check is kept before the check starts, so a check that fails, that GitHub
  refuses or that takes too long says nothing on screen and waits for the next week, and turning the feature off and on
  again does not check sooner. A version it offered is kept across restarts and shown again each time the watcher
  starts, until that version is installed, a later check finds nothing newer, or you turn the feature off. Each check
  makes the requests a check you start makes - to github.com, to GitHub's list of releases and for the Codex
  compatibility data - so GitHub sees this PC's address and the time, once a week. It departs from standards C4, C5 and
  C7, which the page says. **Every check now leaves one line in the watcher's log** (`logs\auto-resume.log`), beginning
  "weekly update check:" - nothing newer (with the newest published version, or that this build is ahead of it), the
  version it offered (a pre-release said so), or why it could not check, in the Dashboard's own words - so a week of
  silence can be told from a week of no news.
- **Both are listed in the advanced edition's count of capabilities** (thirty-two now), with a section of each in the
  editions document and its words in all 18 languages. The advanced edition's Korean catalog calls the watcher 워처,
  as the product's own does.
- **Fixes from an audit of the advanced features.**
  - A run kind that is turned off or only watched still hands a *Stop* to its live turn. Running a conversation here
    while Codex is closed, compacting then continuing, and using Codex's default model at capacity each keep their
    follow-up bookkeeping while off: a *Stop* reaches the turn they started, a row no turn follows is ended as lost,
    and a model they owe back is put back. Before, turning one off left a running turn out of *Stop*'s reach until its
    cap, and a fallback model unrestored.
  - *Stop near a limit* starts no continuation after a reset while another of its windows still holds: the five-hour
    window resetting no longer starts a turn through the app while the weekly window is still held. A continuation
    after the reset that was written and got no answer in time is unconfirmed and no longer told as one that failed
    ("could not continue"); the next look ends the row as superseded if the turn had started.
  - *Compact a full conversation, then continue* continues only after a compaction that completed: a compaction still
    running is waited for, and an interrupted one counts as nothing compacted.
  - *Tell a parent which of its subagents stopped* marks a stop told only when the message carrying its line goes out;
    a message held back, or the program's own words sent instead, no longer marks the subagents told with nothing said.
  - *Continue a turn that ended with no reply* answers only conversations the program takes for a person's own -
    with *Recover every conversation* on, the wider set - so a subagent's or a review's empty turn gets no
    continuation, and a waiting one for a conversation that is not a person's own is ended as withdrawn instead of
    waiting for good.
  - *Goal continuation* and *Marker-free continuation* make the first change of state inside the program's launch
    guard, so a *Pause* or *Cancel* committed after the guard stops them; a guard that fails as it closes after the
    write reads the answer instead of calling it an unsent attempt.
  - *Continue with no words*, turned on again after Codex refused it, is asked again without a watcher restart.
  - The pipe to the Codex app is opened at identification level and talked to only when its server runs as this
    account, in this session, at no lower integrity and outside an AppContainer, before anything is written; otherwise
    it is treated as no app running, so the pipe's server can no longer impersonate the watcher.
  - A resend's claim reads the conversation's day and spacing limits again, as a first claim does, so a claim of the
    same conversation committed between the resend's check and its claim is counted.
  - A goal set while the Codex app may have opened the conversation is unknown, not accepted. *Goal continuation* asks
    whether the app still does not hold the conversation just before it sets the goal, but the app could open it in
    between, and such a set is not seen though the goal read back as active. The question is now asked again once the
    goal reads back; where the app holds the conversation then, the answer is unknown: neither route tries it again,
    and the capability's tripwire turns it off, as its statement already says of a result it cannot confirm. The set is
    never taken back.

### For developers

- **`test_released_calls` records the amendments.** Its rule is still that the scenario modules - `test_engine`,
  `test_outcomes` and the rest of the list in `tests/neutral.py` - are v0.6.10's, byte for byte. The owner's amendment
  of E6 changes four scenarios (the later-terminal-turn and stuck-observing cases of `test_outcomes`' T13 and T17, and
  the two of `test_engine`'s that mirror them): they now expect `turn_completed`, then a recovery with
  `progress_then_turn_cut_off`. The owner's amendment of 2026-10-22 changes five more - three of `test_outcomes`' T16,
  its T48 and one of `test_engine`'s T16 - which keep testing the hand-over, now with the person joining before any
  progress. The `AMENDED` record names the nine test ids, the dates and the decisions. A module may differ from the tag
  in those tests' bodies alone, v0.6.10's run takes each of them from the tag's own module, and the calls v0.6.10's
  made must still begin the calls this checkout's makes: an amended scenario may ask for more ticks, never for other
  calls before them. The cut-off rule has its own module, `tests/test_cut_off_turns.py`, and the person-joined rule
  `tests/test_progress_then_user_joined.py`.
- **The streamed download has a test seam.** `Get-DownloadResponse` in `scripts/bootstrap.ps1` is the one door to the
  network for a download without a deadline; a function of that name in the session stands in for it, as one named
  `Invoke-WebRequest` does. The whole-script tests bridge it to their `Invoke-WebRequest` stand-ins
  (`tests/download_standin.py`), `tests/test_bootstrap_streamed_download.py` holds the behaviour above, and the privacy
  test counts that .NET request as reaching the network. Its tests hash with .NET, as the product does, so they hold
  under the CI runner's `PSModulePath`.
- **The progress lines have a test module of their own**, `tests/test_installer_progress_lines.py`. The installer's
  copy and removal loops use names of their own, because PowerShell's names are case-blind and the removal's `$entries`
  was the table of Add or remove programs entries the uninstall tests stand in for; and its progress function sits
  beside the helpers every lifted installer test takes.
- **No test can reach Windows' real notification centre any more.** The notifier looked up `notify.show_content` as a
  default argument bound when the module was imported, so `test_downgrade`'s patch of it missed and the command line's
  cancel raised a real toast under the product's identity on every run that included it - the "automatic recovery
  cancelled" toasts seen between 2026-10-20 and 2026-10-22 came from there, not from the product. `deliver` and
  `complete` now look it up when called (`tests/test_notifier_show_lookup.py`); `tests/no_real_toast.py`, loaded by
  `tests/sitecustomize.py` and by `scripts/test_parts.py`, refuses a real toast script, fails the test that was
  running even when the refusal is swallowed, and ends a process with status 1 for an attempt no test claimed
  (`tests/test_no_real_toast.py`); and the structural rule is that a default argument in `src/` never names a function
  of another product module.
- **The new behaviours have test modules of their own**, each proved to fail without its change: the setup window's
  pick (`tests/test_gui_pick_window.py`) and prepare step (`tests/test_installer_prepare_step.py`), the open-flyout
  check (`tests/test_tray_overflow_open.py`), the not-resumed notice (`tests/test_not_resumed_notice.py`), words for
  this time mid-dispatch (`tests/test_once_words_race.py`), per-home project rules (`tests/test_project_rule_homes.py`),
  the stale and busy cancels (`tests/test_stale_cancel.py`, `tests/test_toast_cancel_busy.py`), and the advanced
  edition's weekly-check log lines (its own test module).
- **The installer audit's fixes have test modules of their own**: the setup step's stderr, the watcher's restart, the
  uninstall's sweep, the Codex calls' telemetry (`tests/test_installer_codex_telemetry.py`) and the outside gate's
  quotes (`tests/test_outside_gate_quotes.py`), among others. The update-check test records the compatibility data's
  request at the bounded download's door, which it now goes through.
- **The bug hunt's fixes have test modules of their own**: the named object's owner (`tests/test_named_object_owner.py`),
  the update event (`tests/test_update_event_squat.py`), the sequence lead (`tests/test_compat_sequence_lead.py`) and the
  set-aside sweep (`tests/test_set_aside_sweep.py`), and the goal race in the advanced edition's own tests.
- **The Codex homes suggestion has its own test module**, `tests/test_home_suggestions.py`. It reads no registry below the
  adapters: the control layer hands the suggestion the account's `CODEX_HOME` and whether this copy is installed, so no
  test reads this machine's registry or Codex app, and a test that means to look stands in for the lookup.
- **The window audit and the menus have test modules of their own**: `tests/test_gui_v0620_audit.py` (the real window against a
  stand-in `python.exe`), `tests/test_gui_v0620_menus.py`, `tests/test_gui_v0620_keep.py` and `tests/test_motion_menu.py`
  (the picture's right-click scene, with the `right` and `dismiss` steps and the `selected` and `menu` states in the
  motion plan). A window the layout audit builds is measured against the primary screen, as it always was; a person's
  window measures the screen it opens on.
- **The CI release lane is dealt into five parts**, as the standard and advanced lanes' parts are, by the seconds of
  tests recorded in `tests/data/durations.json`, now that the faster layout audits are in it.

## v0.6.17 — Installs from inside another app, the update that keeps its uninstaller, and the capability pairs that kept each other from working

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.16...v0.6.17)

**From v0.6.16, an ordinary update.** It is the latest release, for both editions, so v0.6.16's *Check for updates*
offers it in the edition you have, and the plugin in Codex installs it too. It has no pre-release of its own: it is
v0.6.16 with the fixes below. Both editions change in the first group; the second is the advanced edition's alone,
and what it changes is off until you turn it on.

**Going back.** The watcher's state stays schema 5 and the advanced edition's own file stays version 7, as in
v0.6.16. The file now says the oldest version that reads it safely, and that is v0.6.16, so *Install another
version...* back to v0.6.16 keeps every advanced feature on there, as it was.

### Both editions

- **Installs, updates and repairs started from inside another app are moved outside it.** The Codex app and Claude
  desktop are Windows MSIX apps: a program they start, and everything that program starts, writes the registry and
  `%APPDATA%` into a private view that Windows itself never reads. Measured on this PC first: a process that came
  from either app wrote where only that app could see it, while one started by the desktop shell or by Windows' own
  management service (WMI) wrote where Windows reads. Run from inside such an app, an install here would leave the
  entry in Settings > Apps, the start at sign-in, the notifications' name, the link handler and the Start menu
  entry out of Windows' sight. The Dashboard and the setup program now open again outside by themselves, and
  `Install.cmd`, the installer script it runs - which an update and Repair go through - and the update script's own
  repair, downgrade and watcher-start steps run again outside the same way, passing on what they print and their
  exit code. Where one cannot get out, the Dashboard refuses Repair, installing an update, *Install another
  version...* and a change to *Run at Windows sign-in*, and says why, and the setup program says what would stay
  inside the app before it installs or removes anything. Each decides from what its own process descends from, so
  the warning says it *may* be inside such an app - a tab of Windows Terminal, which is packaged too, can raise it;
  [the guide's troubleshooting entry](GUIDE.md) says what to do either way.
- **An update made in the Dashboard keeps the uninstaller again**, so the installation gets its Settings > Apps and
  winget entry back ([#43](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/43)). Every update the Dashboard started had left it out; the update to v0.6.17 itself
  repairs an install that lost it, and **Repair** now says when it cannot write the entry.
- **Check for updates and Install another version say when pre-releases could not be checked**, and name a GitHub
  rate limit with the time it resets, where GitHub's list was refused because a network - a VPN, a shared
  connection - had used up its requests. Before, the Dashboard said the build was the newest published release,
  and nothing more (reported by [@Kdevaulo](https://github.com/Kdevaulo), [#41](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/41)).
- **The Dashboard opens in front** after a fresh install's *Finish*, and after an update's *Open the Dashboard*.
- **The setup window's light says what is true at each step.** It shows the working light while the product is being
  changed, is lit only once the watcher was confirmed running, and turns grey when an uninstall has finished, when a
  run failed and when the watcher was not confirmed. Before, it stayed lit on the *Uninstalled* page.
- **An uninstall that keeps your settings and history keeps the watcher's log and its error log too.** Before, the
  reinstall after it started `auto-resume.log` afresh. An uninstall with the Dashboard open also no longer leaves a
  note behind asking a later update to open that Dashboard again.
- **The edition-change sentence says "edition" once** in Korean and Chinese, and Korean calls an edition 판 on
  that page's box and its finished page too.
- **A finished install or update says the watcher runs when it does.** On a busy PC the watcher can take longer to
  start than the setup waits for it. The last word and the finished page then said it could not be confirmed, right
  under a health check that had just seen it running. The setup now looks once more before its last word.
- **The Dashboard answers at once in Japanese and Chinese, and Korean, Japanese and Chinese look as Windows draws
  them** ([#48](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/48)). Every click on the Advanced
  features page measured its wrapped text again, and Windows measures unspaced Japanese and Chinese slowly when it has
  to borrow their letters from another font: about 1.7 s per click in Japanese on an English Windows. Measured sizes
  are now remembered, and these three languages are set in the face Windows itself uses for each - Malgun Gothic, Yu
  Gothic UI, Microsoft YaHei UI and Microsoft JhengHei UI - where it is installed: about 0.5 s per click in Japanese
  and 0.2 s in Chinese and Korean there. The other languages look as before.
- **Every language names the two editions in its own words.** Japanese, German, Spanish, French and Portuguese showed
  them in English ("Advanced", "Standard") beside their own words.
- **The setup's log says what it knows.** Where the installer will look at the watcher again at the end, the line
  in the middle says it is not confirmed yet instead of a verdict the last word then contradicts; a Repair's log ends
  "Repaired." instead of "Updated."; and the installer's look at the watcher is written in English like the rest of
  the log.
- **Diagnostics says when the watcher or the Dashboard runs inside another app**, and which one (the Codex app, Claude
  desktop). Inside such an app, what an install registers would land in that app's private view and the watcher may
  end when the app closes; the row says so and what to do.
- **Diagnostics names Codex's sandbox group when it can read the state folder.** Codex's Windows sandbox gives its own
  group (CodexSandboxUsers) read access to the folder; that is now said as what it is, not as other accounts on this
  PC. Any other account, or write access, still gets the warning, whose advice now says how to remove that access
  instead of telling you to move the folder to where it already is.
- **The README and the guide show the setup program installing and updating**, in English and Korean.
- **The motion-picture build reads the compiler's messages in any Windows language**, and a timing test measures
  the tray icon's own CPU work rather than a busy runner.

### Advanced edition

- **The queue for a conversation you open and the continuation with no marker now apply to the same message**
  ([#42](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/42)). The message is queued for opening with no marker and proven by its message id, which Codex keeps. This was
  measured on codex-cli 0.163.0-alpha.10.2: it runs once when the conversation is opened, as your own message, and is
  found by its id. Before, nothing was queued while the continuation with no marker was on. On any other Codex
  the queue carries the message with its marker, as it always did. A continuation for a conversation another
  Codex session holds (a terminal's Codex, VS Code) goes to that session again, with its marker ([#42](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/42), [#47](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/47)).
- **A reset credit spent for the window the usage pause holds lifts the pause** ([#44](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/44)). The pause waited out the
  reset the credit had just made unnecessary; it now goes by when Codex answered the credit, and a credit that is
  unanswered or reset nothing leaves the pause standing, as does another window's.
- **"Sends an hour, all advanced features together" counts sends, not features** ([#45](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/45)). With two or three
  features on one send, the real limit was four to six: a person who set a number now gets that many sends.
- **Continue with no words never takes or loses the message you wrote for this time** ([#46](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/46)). It yields to a
  continuation that carries words beyond the program's own template, and a route that never started puts the words
  back.
- **The other pairs that kept each other from working** ([#47](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/47)):
  the goal continuation beside other sessions (a conversation a session holds goes to that session);
  the goal continuation beside the queue for open (measured on the same Codex: the queued message runs once and the
  goal carries on afterwards, so both apply there; on another Codex the goal carries the conversation alone and the
  journal says so);
  the queue for open takes up usage-limited conversations only, so a full context window waits for its compaction
  and a network or server failure is not queued;
  Continue with no words beside the continuation with no marker (the routes go without words, the continuation with
  no marker serves the sends that carry words);
  several conversations at once now pool the continuation with no marker's sends where that was measured on this
  Codex, and send them one at a time where not;
  and a person's *Send now* wins where it can send, while an early look sends it where *Send now* cannot before a reset.
  When one feature stands aside for another, the journal says so and names it, in place of a silent "acted".
- **The goal continuation resumes the goal after a usage-limit reset again** (fixed by [@Kdevaulo](https://github.com/Kdevaulo),
  [#49](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/pull/49)). Codex 0.163 refuses a queued message that
  names no client message id, and the goal continuation and the continuation with no marker sent one without it when they
  carried the marker. Both now always name one; the goal is set active and read back before its continuation is queued,
  and a failed or unconfirmed activation no longer turns into one ordinary turn.
- **Two sends for one conversation at the same instant count as two** in "Sends an hour, all advanced features
  together". They used to merge into one, so one later send could pass the number by one; the stored state keeps its
  format, so v0.6.16 still reads it.
- **Choosing an option's default stores nothing**, so a later release that changes the default reaches you too. Values
  stored before stay until you change them.
- **Groundwork.** The options table checks names in code only, and the stored state says the oldest version that
  reads it safely - kept at its version, so v0.6.16 still reads it with every feature on after *Install another
  version...*.

## v0.6.16 — Rescan and reconcile, a setup program that is an installer, notices that stay until clicked, and most of the advanced edition

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.15...v0.6.16)

**From v0.6.15, an ordinary update.** It is the latest release, for both editions, so v0.6.15's *Check for updates*
offers it in the edition you have, and the plugin in Codex installs it too. The line went out first in four
pre-releases - v0.6.16-beta, beta.2, beta.3 and beta.4 - and an installation of any of them is offered this as an
ordinary update, being newer. This entry tells everything those four announced, with what was built since beta.4, so
it is enough to read on its own; an item marked "new since beta.4" is new to a person who ran beta.4. **The standard
edition's improvements** are *Rescan and reconcile* on the Pending page
([#39](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/39)), a setup program that is an
installer and an update that shows what it is doing, notices you can keep on screen until clicked, words for one
recovery's next send, up to three more Codex homes, and a conversation Codex records under another id followed.
The advanced edition's capabilities are listed below, each off until you turn it on.

**Going back.** The watcher's state is schema 5, as every v0.6.16 beta's: each record says which Codex home it is
of, and it is brought up from schema 4 the first time it is opened, every row kept. Going back to v0.6.14 or v0.6.13
converts the state down first (`downgrade-state --to 4`), which *Install another version...* does for you: it is
refused while a continuation sent in an extra home may still be in that home's Codex queue. Every row is kept, and
none of an extra home's is left for the older release to act on: its waiting recoveries are cancelled, one whose
recovery turn is running ends unverified, and its finished rows stay as they are. The advanced edition's own file is
version 7 - the continuations, the conversations kept going and the queued prompts, the usage meter's last reading,
the turns run here, the Dashboard chat's table for v0.6.17, and the wrap-up's switches and words - brought up from
version 3, 4, 5 or 6 the first time it is opened, every row kept. An advanced version older than v0.6.16-beta.4
cannot read it and fails closed: every advanced feature is off there (v0.6.14 reads it the same way: every
capability off), and *Install another version...* says so before it installs one.

### Both editions

#### Recovering more conversations

- **A conversation ChatGPT hands over to the Codex app, and one Codex gives no label at all, are now recovered**
  ([#27](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/27)).
  Detection took up only conversations Codex labels `user` and whose file names `Codex Desktop`.
  That label is Codex's analytics classification, not a mark of whose a conversation is: a
  conversation ChatGPT hands over to the app is labelled `chatgpt_handoff` and opened as
  `codex_work_desktop`, and the app gives no label at all to a session it copies in from another
  tool (Claude Code, forks made there included) - 41 of 64 conversations on one PC, made by Codex 0.149 to 0.162. None of them
  was ever recovered, nothing in the log said why, and a person going on with one in Codex met a
  usage limit unanswered: the watcher fails closed on what it does not recognise, so it left them alone. Both are
  taken up now, and nothing wider: a subagent's conversation, a review, a memory pass, one an agent
  made, and the CLI's, the terminal's and VS Code's sessions still stay out, and Codex's state and
  the conversation's own file must still say the same. Found by a person's report and the read-only
  check written for it; the tests that hold it fail with the fix taken out. A copied-in turn
  carries no Codex error code, so nothing in such a session is detected until Codex itself runs a
  turn there that fails (reported by [@barkshah2002-pixel](https://github.com/barkshah2002-pixel), [#27](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/27); proved by [@ZionZhang42](https://github.com/ZionZhang42), [#27](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/27)).
  It is in v0.6.15 too.
- **A conversation whose turns Codex records under another id is followed there.** Codex can carry on a
  conversation's turns under a new id, and a failure there was never found. The watcher now follows every id a
  conversation has had, in order, so its failure is found and an old one never comes back (reported by
  [@aca22jy](https://github.com/aca22jy), [#30](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/30)).
- **A conversation continued in, or forked by, the Codex Desktop is recovered as the app's own.** A conversation
  started in the Codex CLI and then carried on in the Desktop app was reported as "not taken up (other_kind:
  originator codex-tui)" when it hit a usage limit: Codex rewrites the conversation's row to the app's but its
  first line keeps the CLI's originator. The same held for the conversation the app forks from a terminal's with
  "continue in a new chat". Both are now taken up as the app's own; a terminal conversation the app never took
  over, VS Code's own and a subagent's are not, and who holds a conversation still decides whether anything is
  sent (reported by [@Kdevaulo](https://github.com/Kdevaulo),
  [#37](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/37)).
- **A conversation another Codex session holds waits, and nothing is sent to it.** A conversation open in a
  terminal or in VS Code shows "Open in another Codex session (a terminal or VS Code); it continues once the Codex
  app holds it." instead of being sent to; who holds it is read from the process list, and a holder that cannot
  be named, two holders and a reused process id leave the state unknown.
- **Every failed turn the watcher does not take up is logged once, with why** - once per turn and reason,
  across restarts, a few lines at a time (suggested by [@barkshah2002-pixel](https://github.com/barkshah2002-pixel), [#27](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/27)).
- **Diagnostics can check why a failure was not taken up.** *Check why a failure was not taken up...* asks the
  watcher's own rules about the newest 200 conversations, within 10 seconds, and reads nothing of what they say
  (suggested by [@barkshah2002-pixel](https://github.com/barkshah2002-pixel), [#27](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/27)).

#### The Pending page

- **Rescan and reconcile on the Pending page** (the standard edition's improvement; new since beta.4). After
  *Cancel all*, a button
  that reads every waiting recovery again, once you confirm. It retires a wait only on positive proof that newer
  work of yours superseded it - its exact failed turn in Codex's history followed by a turn you started (a
  continuation of this tool's never counts; after a rollback, nothing does) - rechecks the valid ones under every normal gate, leaves the uncertain ones as they are, and
  re-reads each one before applying and skips any that changed. It sends nothing, writes nothing to Codex's files
  and resets no budget; the note beside the buttons says how many were retired, rechecked, left unresolved and
  changed meanwhile (reported by [@weng-wen-jun](https://github.com/weng-wen-jun),
  [#39](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/39)).
- **Words for this time.** One waiting recovery on the Pending page can carry words of yours - **Add words for
  this time...** on its row - sent once, after the continuation it would send anyway, and then deleted. They
  start, speed up and skip nothing, and are deleted too when the recovery ends without a send. They are a Custom
  message in every other way, written only in the Dashboard (standards A26 and A27, amended by the owner).

#### Several Codex homes

- **Up to three more Codex homes.** *Settings > Advanced > Codex homes* names up to three more `CODEX_HOME` folders
  besides the default one, each with a short alias. One watcher recovers in every home it holds, each through its own
  reader, Codex process, lock and engine, and a record goes only to its own home. Pending, History, the Codex panel and
  the cards add the alias to a record of an extra home.
- **Locked by folder.** Each home is locked by its path and by its folder, so one folder under two names is one home,
  and two installations never watch it twice. A UNC path, a link, a missing state database and a folder named twice are
  refused when it is saved.
- **Only the Dashboard writes them.** Codex's `update_settings` refuses the field, and no Codex reply carries the
  paths. Restore defaults keeps them. Removing a home cancels the recoveries waiting in it (the owner's answer), and
  one already in Codex's queue is watched until it settles.
- **Measured up to 0.162.** MH, a second home reached by the desktop app, passed on codex-cli 0.158 and again on
  codex-cli 0.162.0-alpha.17.2; on a Codex newer than 0.162 the card says it is unmeasured until it is measured again.

#### The setup program, updates and notices

- **The setup program is an installer** (new since beta.4). Double-clicked, it opens a window of its own in the
  Dashboard's design and
  the product's eighteen languages: what it installs, which edition and version, and where; the few choices the
  installer has; how far it is and which step it is on; and whether it finished, with the exit code and the log,
  and a button that opens the Dashboard. Run where its own version is installed already, it offers **Repair** and
  **Remove**. No console window opens, and `-Silent` asks nothing and shows nothing, with the same exit codes.
- **An installation is listed in Windows' Settings > Apps** and in `winget list`, for your Windows user only (new
  since beta.4). Its
  Uninstall button shows the same window and asks whether to delete the settings and the history too. The uninstall
  closes an open Dashboard first and removes nothing while anything still holds the program's files, saying what;
  a failed uninstall stays listed, a finished one takes its entry with it, and installing an older version leaves no
  entry naming a version that is not installed.
  The winget manifests of both editions are made from a release's pinned archives ([WINGET.md](WINGET.md)).
- **An update shows itself** (new since beta.4) - from this version's own *Check for updates* on, and the setup
  program run by hand; the
  update to v0.6.16 from an earlier version runs as that version always did. Before it installs, a notes page says
  from what version to what and what is new in it, read from the verified download; afterwards an "Updated to" page says it is done. The watcher is started
  again on the new version where one ran before or where it runs at sign-in, and one you had stopped stays
  stopped. An open Dashboard is asked to close and opens again on the new version where it was - one from before
  v0.6.16, which cannot be asked, is closed as any window is and opened again - and one with unsaved Settings
  changes keeps them and stays open. The notes are shown as plain text, and the window follows the installation's
  own look.
- **Installing over a running v0.6.11 to v0.6.15 watcher no longer reports a false failure**, and the
  installer's Korean lines reach you and the Dashboard whole (#33). This was the known issue of v0.6.15,
  v0.6.16-beta and v0.6.16-beta.2: updating from v0.6.11 to v0.6.15 could show an error window saying "Setup did
  not complete ... Not a state an older watcher owns" with its Korean lines as broken characters, though the update
  had finished - one step of the installer read the state while the old watcher still held it, in a format that
  step did not know yet.
- **Notices that stay until clicked, chosen for each kind** (new since beta.4). *Settings > General >
  Notifications* lists each kind
  of notice with a box, and a kind ticked there stays on screen until you click it. None is ticked at first.
- **A click on a notice itself opens its page** (new since beta.4) - the card's face, or the body of Windows' own
  notification - the
  page its Open Dashboard button opens.
- **Settings' Run at Windows sign-in shows what Windows really holds**, and Save writes it only where you moved
  it; an update keeps the entry you kept (#31).
- **The panel says how to start the watcher when it is off**, and that nothing starts it while sign-in is off
  (#31).
- **Release pages start with direct download links** to the tag's two setup programs, so the page you land on
  from an update notice begins with what to download.
- **The version picker reads the advanced edition's new file** and warns that every advanced feature is off in an
  advanced version older than this one.

#### The window

- **A smoother tray icon while it idles** (new since beta.4), in finer steps of the same drawing, and **a smaller
  edition label** beside the version.
- **The product's icon in every window's title bar.** *Install another version...*, the Timeline and the Log
  showed Windows' default form icon - red, blue and yellow squares - in their title bars; they show the Dashboard's
  own icon now, in both editions (owner, 2026-10-10).
- **One-line text boxes show their whole line**, and the Codex homes card no longer runs into what is beside
  it (#34).
- **When a card is shown and the keyboard focus moves, the log says where it went**, by window class and
  program (#32).

#### Documents and compatibility

- **The README is the short one** (new since beta.4): the setup program first, the Dashboard shown in motion, and
  one table of what to read next.
- **The guide says what Codex does about a full conversation**: Codex retries a failed request itself, the
  standard edition never retries a turn that failed because the conversation outgrew its model's context window,
  and the program never sends `/compact` - a queued `/compact` reaches Codex as plain text.
- **Compatibility data 11** (new since beta.4) names codex-cli 0.163.0-alpha.10.2 as verified in eight capabilities,
  after a real recovery on it; it is checked in all twelve of its capabilities.
- **The compatibility report stamps a report with the process's clock** (new since beta.4), not the clock its module
  was imported under.

### Advanced edition

#### Several conversations at once, and five more ways to go on

- **Several conversations at once.** Two to four continuations wait for Codex's answer at once, each in a
  conversation of its own, while every check, every claim and the last look before each send still run one at a time
  (2 by default; more only once MQ passes on your Codex). A send whose fate cannot be known turns it off. Departs from
  0.5 and A19.
- **Queue for when a conversation is opened.** A usage-limited conversation the app does not have open is sent the
  ordinary continuation anyway and left in Codex's queue, for the days you choose (3 to 7); the program takes it back
  at seven days and an hour whatever it is told, and at once when this is turned off. Opened and not run within three
  minutes, it is taken back, sent the ordinary way, and this turns off. Departs from A11.
- **Continue a turn that ended with no reply.** A turn Codex completed with only your message and its reasoning in
  it - judged by the kinds of item alone, never their words - is continued once in fixed words, a run of them twice at
  most; a goal Codex keeps going or has stopped is left alone. Departs from 0.5, A13 and A26.
- **Tell a parent which of its subagents stopped.** One fixed line for each subagent that stopped on a failure, five
  at most, added to the parent's own continuation; once MS passes, a parent that finished normally is sent one too.
  Nothing is ever written to a subagent. Departs from 0.5, A15 and A26.
- **Keep a conversation going.** A conversation you pick, with a count of 1 to 10, is sent "Carry on with the next
  step of the plan." after each turn that ended well, and stops on no progress, a finished plan, an active goal, a
  failed or interrupted turn, or the count used; three at most until MK passes. Departs from A13, A26 and B9.
- **Queue messages for later.** Your own messages for one conversation, after the turn now running, at a time, or
  every day or week - in order, each once, one waiting for the one before it where you ask; paced like every recovery,
  fifteen minutes apart and five a day in one conversation (the owner's answer). Departs from A8, A17, A26, A27, C4,
  D2, H4 and H6.

#### Running turns here, and more kinds of conversation

- **Run a conversation here while Codex is closed.** When a recovery is due in a conversation nothing has open,
  one turn runs here on Codex's own app server, with the program's ordinary continuation and marker and the
  settings Codex saved for the conversation. Every approval is declined; a conversation saved with full access,
  an outside sandbox or approvals that go to anyone else is refused before anything starts; the turn ends at the
  hours you chose (one to six) or at once when the Codex app starts. **Turns run here now** on the Advanced
  features page lists each turn with its cap and a Stop that asks first - the only way to stop one; no Codex tool
  reaches it.
- **Recover CLI, TUI and VS Code conversations.** Also finds the failures of conversations run in a terminal or
  the VS Code extension. While another Codex session holds one, the continuation goes through `codex queue` for
  that session; if the session ends first it is taken back. Pending and History add " · CLI" or " · VS Code" to
  such a row, and one a newer Codex wrote than the engine installed waits until Codex is updated. A recovery
  waiting in a terminal or VS Code conversation ends as cancelled because that kind is off when the watcher starts
  with *Recover CLI, TUI and VS Code conversations* off, instead of being reported as superseded (new since beta.4).
- **Compact a full conversation, then continue.** A turn that failed because the conversation outgrew its model's
  context window is compacted and continued once: where the app has it open, Pending says "Run /compact in Codex;
  it continues after"; where nothing holds it and Codex is closed, it is compacted here. The program never sends
  `/compact`.
- **Use Codex's default model when one is at capacity.** After the attempts you chose (one to three) on a
  conversation nothing holds, one turn runs on Codex's default model and the conversation's own model is put back
  and read back; if Codex refuses, Pending and History say "This conversation now uses another model; switch it
  back in Codex".
- **Continue with no words.** A turn run here can start with no words, proven by the id it came back with, and
  History says "continued with no words, proven by its id"; where Codex refuses it, the usual words are used and
  the capability turns itself off. Codex's own retry settings are not offered: Codex refuses any write there.
- **Recover every conversation but Codex's own** takes up a failed turn in any conversation of the app except
  subagents, reviews, memory passes and the ones an agent made.
- **Start with Codex starts the watcher after a restart too**, and every start it does not make says why (#31).

#### Near a usage limit

- **Usage meter, Wrap up near a limit and Stop near a limit** (Pause near a limit in beta.3; suggested by
  [@Hunweibyn](https://github.com/Hunweibyn), [#29](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/29)). The meter reads your Codex usage on a schedule you pick and warns near
  a limit; the wrap-up asks each running turn to finish its step; the stop holds the product's continuations until
  the reset. Both need the meter, which turns on with them. They are finished as follows:
  - the wrap-up's exact words are shown before they are sent, can be your own for each window, and can carry the
    numbers (`{percent}`, `{window}`, `{stop_at}`) and the reset time;
  - **Wrap up near a limit** and **Stop near a limit** each have their own five-hour and weekly switches, and the
    usage meter's pair decides only its warnings (new since beta.4). An update keeps what a beta.4 meter's window
    switch meant: a window switched off there stays off for the wrap-up and the stop (the owner's request);
  - every number has *Custom...* beside its presets, checked before it is saved, with the reason shown. It opens
    the Settings page's small dialog for a number of your own - the range above it, the number, *Use this value*
    and *Cancel* - instead of a row of its own under the drop-down; a value taken shows as its own item before
    *Custom...*, and Cancel leaves the drop-down as it was (the owner's request; the dialog is new since beta.4);
  - three numbers a window - where to warn, where to wrap up and where to stop the running turn - kept in order;
  - the stop goes through the Codex app's own internal channel for a conversation the app has open, once a
    window a reset, and where it cannot, our continuations are held and a notice says so;
  - a conversation wrapped up or stopped is continued once after its window resets;
  - the near-limit notices are in all 18 languages, and each is a kind to keep on screen - the usage meter's
    warning, a turn the forced stop could not stop, a queue to resume in Codex, and a conversation that could not
    be continued after the reset - each ticked or not on its own in the Notifications list (new since beta.4).

#### Turning capabilities on and keeping them on

- **Every on/off choice on the Advanced features page is a switch**, as on the Settings page (new since beta.4).
- **What a capability needs, it turns on with it.** A capability can need another, and turning it on turns on
  what it needs in the one confirmation, with every statement in front of you; turning a needed one off first
  turns off what needs it (the owner's request; standard K3 amended by the owner).
- **Keep it on turns a capability on**, in one confirmation, and is refused for one that may not be kept on. It
  sits in view, in a capability's head card under its state, and the list says "· kept on" (suggested by
  [@Hunweibyn](https://github.com/Hunweibyn), [#29](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/29)).
- **A watched capability can be set up**: a message or a credit at a reset, a conversation kept going and a
  queued message are counted as what they would have done, and never sent.
- **Reinstalling the same edition after an uninstall that kept your data works like an update** (new since beta.4):
  the advanced features you turned on, kept on and set up stay as they were. Installing the advanced edition after
  the standard one still starts every advanced feature off (standard K2, as the owner amended it on 2026-10-18).

#### What changed for the capabilities you have

- **Cancel and Pause take back a message Codex already holds.** A message at a reset, a queued message or one of the
  edition's own continuations already in Codex's queue is taken back out of it by a Cancel or a Pause, as the program
  takes back its own; if Codex will not give it back, the row says so and it is never sent again (the owner's answer).
  A message at a reset taken back this way is cancelled; a queued message, held for you to say go on or cancel. *Send
  your own message when a limit resets* is revision 2 for it, and asks to be read again.
- **Longer messages.** *Longer reset messages* is now *Longer messages*, revision 2: it lets a queued message be up to
  8,154 characters too.
- **Three capabilities also name H2.** *Short retries when Codex is at capacity* moves A20's caps, which are the
  engine's, and *Rules for Codex's error codes* and *Retry failures it cannot name* retry failures nothing classified:
  H2 says no setting can do either, so their statements now name H2 beside the rest. Each is revision 2, and one you
  turned on turns off until you confirm its statement again.
- **An edited message is yours.** A message you edit in Codex's queue is left there, never deleted and never counted
  against the capability that sent it.
- **A watched capability's log** keeps its newest 200 lines (was 250), so every capability watched at once still fits
  inside the journal.
- **The Advanced features page lists them by importance**, the compatibility report first: then what gets work going
  again after a usage limit by itself, what saves you work, the other common failures, and last the rare cases and
  expert settings (the owner's order). A capability's warnings never move it down.

#### Measured again

- **On codex-cli 0.162.0-alpha.17.2** every measurement was made again (2026-10-10,
  [`docs/evidence/live/`](evidence/live/)). MW, M1, M5, M6, M7, MA and MH passed again, M2b and MP1 to MP3 passed
  for the first time, and M2, M3 and M4 failed again. MU, MN and MR passed too, so the reset credit and the message
  at a reset no longer carry an unsettled warning there.
- **On codex-cli 0.163.0-alpha.10.2** (app 26.1013.3656.0) MW, M1, M2b, M5, M6, M7, MP1 to MP3, MIPC, MO, MX, MF,
  M3B and M6B all passed. A capability whose measurement was not made on your version of Codex shows it as a
  warning, as before; one whose measurement passed on the Codex in force shows no warning for it.
- **What follows from the 0.162 measurements.** The goal continuation also acts on a conversation the app holds
  where M2b passed: it sets the paused goal active, then adds the continuation to the conversation's queue. Its
  statement says so at revision 2, and one you turned on asks to be confirmed again. The panel beside the chat
  passed MP1 to MP3, so the [guide](GUIDE.md#the-panel-beside-the-chat) describes it now.
- **Read-only probes** measure what stop-now, send-now and cloud tasks would need, driving nothing; none of
  them is built yet.

#### Known limits

- MQ, ME, MS, MK and MT are not measured yet: every capability that rests on one says so as a warning you confirm.
- The Dashboard's Pending list shows a continuation queued for opening as Codex's own queued row; it does not yet say
  that it runs when you open the conversation.
- The Dashboard chat and the Codex Stop hook are v0.6.17's; nothing of them is built here beyond the table that
  stores the chat.

### For developers

- The edition audit counts no name Python's standard library gives a module as a sign of the advanced edition.
- `build/make_motion.py` draws the README's motion pictures from the window itself, offscreen, at the product's own
  cadence, as lossless APNGs: the same frames always give the same bytes.

## v0.6.16-beta.4 — A conversation nothing holds is run here, other kinds of session, and the usage capabilities finished

[The commits in this pre-release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.16-beta.3...v0.6.16-beta.4)

**A pre-release: stage 4 of the advanced edition, the usage capabilities finished, and two fixes for both
editions.** It is a GitHub pre-release, so `releases/latest` stays v0.6.15; an installation of v0.6.15 or of an
earlier v0.6.16 beta is offered it by *Check for updates*, which asks first and says it is tested less, and
*Install another version...* lists it. As with v0.6.16-beta.3, a plugin copy older than v0.6.11-beta.2's cannot
read a numbered pre-release: set up and repair with the installation's own copy.

**Going back.** The watcher's state stays schema 5. The advanced edition's own file is now version 7 - the
turns run here, the Dashboard chat's table for v0.6.17, the wrap-up's switches and words - brought up from
version 5 or 6 the first time it is opened, every row kept. An advanced version older than this one cannot read
it and fails closed: every advanced feature is off there, and *Install another version...* says so before it
installs one.

### Both editions

- **A conversation continued in, or forked by, the Codex Desktop is recovered as the app's own.** A conversation
  started in the Codex CLI and then carried on in the Desktop app was reported as "not taken up (other_kind:
  originator codex-tui)" when it hit a usage limit: Codex rewrites the conversation's row to the app's but its
  first line keeps the CLI's originator. The same held for the conversation the app forks from a terminal's with
  "continue in a new chat". Both are now taken up as the app's own; a terminal conversation the app never took
  over, VS Code's own and a subagent's are not, and who holds a conversation still decides whether anything is
  sent (reported by [@Kdevaulo](https://github.com/Kdevaulo),
  [#37](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/37)).
- **A conversation another Codex session holds waits, and nothing is sent to it.** A conversation open in a
  terminal or in VS Code shows "Open in another Codex session (a terminal or VS Code); it continues once the Codex
  app holds it." instead of being sent to; who holds it is read from the process list, and a holder that cannot
  be named, two holders and a reused process id leave the state unknown.
- **Release pages start with direct download links** to the tag's two setup programs, so the page you land on
  from an update notice begins with what to download.
- **Compatibility data 10** names codex-cli 0.163.0-alpha.10.2: checked in all twelve of its capabilities, none
  verified yet.
- **The guide says what Codex does about a full conversation**: Codex retries a failed request itself, the
  standard edition never retries a turn that failed because the conversation outgrew its model's context window,
  and the program never sends `/compact` - a queued `/compact` reaches Codex as plain text.
- **The version picker reads the advanced edition's new file** and says that every advanced feature is off in an
  advanced version older than this one.

### Advanced edition

- **Run a conversation here while Codex is closed.** When a recovery is due in a conversation nothing has open,
  one turn runs here on Codex's own app server, with the program's ordinary continuation and marker and the
  settings Codex saved for the conversation. Every approval is declined; a conversation saved with full access,
  an outside sandbox or approvals that go to anyone else is refused before anything starts; the turn ends at the
  hours you chose (one to six) or at once when the Codex app starts. **Turns run here now** on the Advanced
  features page lists each turn with its cap and a Stop that asks first - the only way to stop one; no Codex tool
  reaches it.
- **Recover CLI, TUI and VS Code conversations.** Also finds the failures of conversations run in a terminal or
  the VS Code extension. While another Codex session holds one, the continuation goes through `codex queue` for
  that session; if the session ends first it is taken back. Pending and History add " · CLI" or " · VS Code" to
  such a row, and one a newer Codex wrote than the engine installed waits until Codex is updated.
- **Compact a full conversation, then continue.** A turn that failed because the conversation outgrew its model's
  context window is compacted and continued once: where the app has it open, Pending says "Run /compact in Codex;
  it continues after"; where nothing holds it and Codex is closed, it is compacted here. The program never sends
  `/compact`.
- **Use Codex's default model when one is at capacity.** After the attempts you chose (one to three) on a
  conversation nothing holds, one turn runs on Codex's default model and the conversation's own model is put back
  and read back; if Codex refuses, Pending and History say "This conversation now uses another model; switch it
  back in Codex".
- **Continue with no words.** A turn run here can start with no words, proven by the id it came back with, and
  History says "continued with no words, proven by its id"; where Codex refuses it, the usual words are used and
  the capability turns itself off. Codex's own retry settings are not offered: Codex refuses any write there.
- **Usage meter, wrap-up and Stop near a limit, finished** (suggested by [@Hunweibyn](https://github.com/Hunweibyn),
  [#29](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/29)):
  - the wrap-up's exact words are shown before they are sent, can be your own for each window, and can carry the
    numbers (`{percent}`, `{window}`, `{stop_at}`) and the reset time;
  - each usage window - the five-hour and the weekly - is switched on or off on its own;
  - every number has *Custom...* beside its presets, checked before it is saved, with the reason shown;
  - three numbers a window - where to warn, where to wrap up and where to stop the running turn - kept in order;
  - the stop goes through the Codex app's own internal channel for a conversation the app has open, once a
    window a reset, and where it cannot, our continuations are held and a notice says so;
  - a conversation wrapped up or stopped is continued once after its window resets;
  - the near-limit notices are in all 18 languages.
- **Keep it on turns a capability on**, in one confirmation, and is refused for one that may not be kept on.
- **Measurements made again on codex-cli 0.163.0-alpha.10.2** (app 26.1013.3656.0): MW, M1, M2b, M5, M6, M7,
  MP1 to MP3, MIPC, MO, MX, MF, M3B and M6B all passed there. A capability whose measurement was not made on
  your version of Codex shows it as a warning, as before.
- **The Dashboard chat and the Codex Stop hook** are v0.6.17's; nothing of them is built here beyond the table
  that stores the chat.

## v0.6.16-beta.3 — Words for this time, a conversation Codex records under another id, and a usage meter

[The commits in this pre-release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.16-beta.2...v0.6.16-beta.3)

**A pre-release: the standard edition's words for this time, the fixes people reported, and stage 4's first
capabilities.** It is a GitHub pre-release, so `releases/latest` stays v0.6.15; an installation of v0.6.15 or
of an earlier v0.6.16 beta is offered it by *Check for updates*, which asks first and says it is tested less,
and *Install another version...* lists it. As with v0.6.16-beta.2, a plugin copy older than v0.6.11-beta.2's
cannot read a numbered pre-release: set up and repair with the installation's own copy.

**Going back.** The watcher's state stays schema 5, as v0.6.16-beta's. The advanced edition's own file is now
version 5 - the usage meter's last reading - brought up from version 4 the first time it is opened, every row
kept. An advanced version older than this one cannot read it and fails closed: every advanced feature is off
there, and *Install another version...* says so before it installs one.

### Both editions

- **Words for this time.** One waiting recovery on the Pending page can carry words of yours - **Add words for
  this time...** on its row - sent once, after the continuation it would send anyway, and then deleted. They
  start, speed up and skip nothing, and are deleted too when the recovery ends without a send. They are a Custom
  message in every other way, written only in the Dashboard (standards A26 and A27, amended by the owner).
- **A conversation whose turns Codex records under another id is followed there.** Codex can carry on a
  conversation's turns under a new id, and a failure there was never found. The watcher now follows every id a
  conversation has had, in order, so its failure is found and an old one never comes back (reported by
  [@aca22jy](https://github.com/aca22jy), [#30](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/30)).
- **Every failed turn the watcher does not take up is logged once, with why** - once per turn and reason,
  across restarts, a few lines at a time (suggested by [@barkshah2002-pixel](https://github.com/barkshah2002-pixel), [#27](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/27)).
- **Diagnostics can check why a failure was not taken up.** *Check why a failure was not taken up...* asks the
  watcher's own rules about the newest 200 conversations, within 10 seconds, and reads nothing of what they say
  (suggested by [@barkshah2002-pixel](https://github.com/barkshah2002-pixel), [#27](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/27)).
- **Settings' Run at Windows sign-in shows what Windows really holds**, and Save writes it only where you moved
  it; an update keeps the entry you kept (#31).
- **The panel says how to start the watcher when it is off**, and that nothing starts it while sign-in is off
  (#31).
- **Installing over a running v0.6.11 to v0.6.15 watcher no longer reports a false failure**, and the
  installer's Korean lines reach you and the Dashboard whole (#33). This was the known issue of v0.6.15,
  v0.6.16-beta and v0.6.16-beta.2.
- **One-line text boxes show their whole line**, and the Codex homes card no longer runs into what is beside
  it (#34).
- **When a card is shown and the keyboard focus moves, the log says where it went**, by window class and
  program (#32).
- **The version picker warns** that every advanced feature is off in an advanced version older than this one.

### Advanced edition

- **Start with Codex starts the watcher after a restart too**, and every start it does not make says why (#31).
- **What a capability needs, it turns on with it.** A capability can need another, and turning it on turns on
  what it needs in the one confirmation, with every statement in front of you; turning a needed one off first
  turns off what needs it (the owner's request; standard K3 amended by the owner).
- **Usage meter, Wrap up near a limit and Pause near a limit.** The meter reads your Codex usage on a schedule
  you pick and warns near a limit; the wrap-up asks each running turn to finish its step; the pause holds the
  product's continuations until the reset. Both need the meter (suggested by [@Hunweibyn](https://github.com/Hunweibyn), [#29](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/29)).
- **Recover every conversation but Codex's own** takes up a failed turn in any conversation of the app except
  subagents, reviews, memory passes and the ones an agent made.
- **Keep it on sits in view**, in a capability's head card under its state, and the list says "· kept on".
- **A watched capability can be set up**: a message or a credit at a reset, a conversation kept going and a
  queued message are counted as what they would have done, and never sent.
- **MU, MN and MR passed** on codex-cli 0.162.0-alpha.17.2, so the reset credit and the message at a reset no
  longer carry an unsettled warning there.
- **Read-only probes** measure what stop-now, send-now and cloud tasks would need, driving nothing; none of
  them is built yet.

## v0.6.16-beta.2 — Conversations ChatGPT hands over, and the ones Codex labels not at all, are recovered

[The commits in this pre-release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.16-beta...v0.6.16-beta.2)

**A pre-release with one fix, for both editions: v0.6.15's, on the beta line.** It is a GitHub
pre-release, so `releases/latest` stays v0.6.15; an installation of v0.6.15, v0.6.15-beta or
v0.6.16-beta is offered it by *Check for updates*, which asks first and says it is tested less, and
*Install another version...* lists it. Everything else is v0.6.16-beta's.

**A plugin copy older than v0.6.11-beta.2's cannot read this version.** The bootstraps published
from v0.6.0 to v0.6.11-beta read no number after `-beta`, so none of them can compare
`0.6.16-beta.2` with anything; v0.6.11-beta.2's copy and every later one read it. Set up and repair
with the installation's own copy, `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume\app\scripts\bootstrap.ps1`, or
with a plugin at v0.6.11-beta.2 or later.

### Both editions

#### Fixes

- **A conversation ChatGPT hands over to the Codex app, and one Codex gives no label at all, are now
  recovered** ([#27](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/27)).
  Detection took up only conversations Codex labels `user` and whose file names `Codex Desktop`.
  That label is Codex's analytics classification, not a mark of whose a conversation is: a
  conversation ChatGPT hands over to the app is labelled `chatgpt_handoff` and opened as
  `codex_work_desktop`, and the app gives no label at all to a session it copies in from another
  tool (Claude Code, forks made there included) - 41 of 64 conversations on one PC, made by Codex 0.149 to 0.162. None of them
  was ever recovered, nothing in the log said why, and a person going on with one in Codex met a
  usage limit unanswered: the watcher fails closed on what it does not recognise, so it left them alone. Both are
  taken up now, and nothing wider: a subagent's conversation, a review, a memory pass, one an agent
  made, and the CLI's, the terminal's and VS Code's sessions still stay out, and Codex's state and
  the conversation's own file must still say the same. Found by a person's report and the read-only
  check written for it; the tests that hold it fail with the fix taken out. A copied-in turn
  carries no Codex error code, so nothing in such a session is detected until Codex itself runs a
  turn there that fails (reported by [@barkshah2002-pixel](https://github.com/barkshah2002-pixel), [#27](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/27); proved by [@ZionZhang42](https://github.com/ZionZhang42), [#27](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/27)).

### Advanced edition

Nothing of its own: the fix above is in both editions.

### Known issue

- **Updating from v0.6.11 to v0.6.15, an error window may say "Setup did not complete ... Not a state an
  older watcher owns", and its Korean lines may show as broken characters.** The update did finish: the files
  are replaced, the watcher that starts brings the state up to this release's format, and Diagnostics shows
  the new version. Nothing needs doing. One step of the installer read the state while the old watcher still
  held it, in a format that step did not know yet, and reported that as a failure (found 2026-10-13; fixed in
  a coming release).

## v0.6.16-beta — Several conversations at once, several Codex homes, and five more ways to go on

[The commits in this pre-release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.15-beta...v0.6.16-beta)

**The pre-release v0.6.15-beta, published again under the number it now has.** Nothing in it changed
but the number: v0.6.15 became a fix alone on v0.6.14 ([#27](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/27)), so the rest of the advanced
edition is v0.6.16 and this is its first pre-release (owner, 2026-10-13). It is a GitHub pre-release,
so `releases/latest` stays v0.6.15; an installation of v0.6.15 or v0.6.15-beta is offered it by
*Check for updates*, which asks first and says it is tested less, and *Install another version...*
lists it. What it carries is in the v0.6.15-beta entry below. It does not carry v0.6.15's fix yet:
v0.6.16-beta.2, right after it, does.

### Both editions

## v0.6.15 — Conversations ChatGPT hands over, and the ones Codex labels not at all, are recovered

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.14...v0.6.15)

**A fix alone, on v0.6.14 - and from v0.6.14, an ordinary update.** It is the latest release, for
both editions, so v0.6.14's *Check for updates* offers it in the edition you have, and the plugin in
Codex installs it too. Nothing else changed: no setting, no stored format, no capability. The owner
had it published as a final of its own (2026-10-13) so that every v0.6.14 is offered it; the rest of
the advanced edition, planned as v0.6.15, is now v0.6.16 ([ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)), and the
pre-release v0.6.15-beta is published again as v0.6.16-beta.

**From v0.6.15-beta, it is offered too, being newer by number - and it is v0.6.14's code.** Stay on
the beta line (v0.6.16-beta.2 carries this fix) if you use what that beta added. Taken anyway, it
brings the state v0.6.15-beta wrote back to the format v0.6.14 reads before the watcher starts, a
copy kept beside it (`state.v5-backup-*.sqlite`): every record stays, a record of another Codex
home is no longer acted on (one still waiting is cancelled), and while a continuation sent to
another home may still be in its queue the watcher waits instead. The advanced edition's
capabilities read as off, as v0.6.14 reads that beta's file.

### Both editions

#### Fixes

- **A conversation ChatGPT hands over to the Codex app, and one Codex gives no label at all, are now
  recovered** ([#27](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/27)).
  Detection took up only conversations Codex labels `user` and whose file names `Codex Desktop`.
  That label is Codex's analytics classification, not a mark of whose a conversation is: a
  conversation ChatGPT hands over to the app is labelled `chatgpt_handoff` and opened as
  `codex_work_desktop`, and the app gives no label at all to a session it copies in from another
  tool (Claude Code, forks made there included) - 41 of 64 conversations on one PC, made by Codex 0.149 to 0.162. None of them
  was ever recovered, nothing in the log said why, and a person going on with one in Codex met a
  usage limit unanswered: the watcher fails closed on what it does not recognise, so it left them alone. Both are
  taken up now, and nothing wider: a subagent's conversation, a review, a memory pass, one an agent
  made, and the CLI's, the terminal's and VS Code's sessions still stay out, and Codex's state and
  the conversation's own file must still say the same. Found by a person's report and the read-only
  check written for it; the tests that hold it fail with the fix taken out. A copied-in turn
  carries no Codex error code, so nothing in such a session is detected until Codex itself runs a
  turn there that fails (reported by [@barkshah2002-pixel](https://github.com/barkshah2002-pixel), [#27](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/27); proved by [@ZionZhang42](https://github.com/ZionZhang42), [#27](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/27)).

### Advanced edition

Nothing of its own: the fix above is in both editions.

### Known issue

- **Updating from v0.6.15-beta, an error window may say the update did not finish.** It did: the files are
  replaced, the watcher that starts brings the state back to the format this release reads (a copy kept), and
  Diagnostics shows v0.6.15. Nothing needs doing. One step of the installer read the state before the new
  watcher had converted it, and reported that as a failure (found 2026-10-13; fixed in a coming release).

## v0.6.15-beta — Several conversations at once, several Codex homes, and five more ways to go on

[The commits in this pre-release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.14...v0.6.15-beta)

**Published again as v0.6.16-beta (2026-10-13).** Built from main 43494538 and published on 2026-10-11;
when v0.6.15 became a fix alone on v0.6.14 two days later, this pre-release's content was published again,
unchanged, as v0.6.16-beta. Its page and archives stay as they were, and *Check for updates* no longer offers
it: v0.6.15 and v0.6.16-beta are both newer.

**A pre-release, the first of v0.6.15 (stage 3c).** It is a GitHub pre-release, so `releases/latest` stays
v0.6.14; an installation of v0.6.14 is offered it by *Check for updates*, which asks first and says it is tested
less, and *Install another version...* lists it. The standard edition gains one thing - watching up to three
more Codex homes - and keeps every standard. The advanced edition gains six capabilities, each off until you turn it
on in the Dashboard's **Advanced features** page, with a statement in your language that names the standards it
departs from ([EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md#todays-capabilities)).

**Going back.** The watcher's state is now schema 5: each record says which Codex home it is of. It is brought up
from schema 4 the first time it is opened, every row kept. To go back to v0.6.14 or v0.6.13, *Install another
version...* converts it down first (`downgrade-state --to 4`): it is refused while a continuation sent in an extra
home may still be in that home's Codex queue. Every row is kept, and none of an extra home's is left for the older
release to act on: its waiting recoveries are cancelled, one whose recovery turn is running ends unverified, and its
finished rows stay as they are. The advanced edition's own file is now version 4
- the continuations, the conversations kept going and the queued prompts - brought up from version 3 when it is first
opened; v0.6.14 cannot read version 4 and fails closed: every capability off.

### Both editions

### Several Codex homes (standard edition)

- **Up to three more Codex homes.** *Settings > Advanced > Codex homes* names up to three more `CODEX_HOME` folders
  besides the default one, each with a short alias. One watcher recovers in every home it holds, each through its own
  reader, Codex process, lock and engine, and a record goes only to its own home. Pending, History, the Codex panel and
  the cards add the alias to a record of an extra home.
- **Locked by folder.** Each home is locked by its path and by its folder, so one folder under two names is one home,
  and two installations never watch it twice. A UNC path, a link, a missing state database and a folder named twice are
  refused when it is saved.
- **Only the Dashboard writes them.** Codex's `update_settings` refuses the field, and no Codex reply carries the
  paths. Restore defaults keeps them. Removing a home cancels the recoveries waiting in it (the owner's answer), and
  one already in Codex's queue is watched until it settles.
- **Measured up to 0.162.** MH, a second home reached by the desktop app, passed on codex-cli 0.158 and again on
  codex-cli 0.162.0-alpha.17.2; on a Codex newer than 0.162 the card says it is unmeasured until it is measured again.

### Fixes

- **The product's icon in every window's title bar.** *Install another version...*, the Timeline and the Log
  showed Windows' default form icon - red, blue and yellow squares - in their title bars; they show the Dashboard's
  own icon now, in both editions (owner, 2026-10-10).

### Advanced edition

### Advanced: several conversations at once

- **Several conversations at once.** Two to four continuations wait for Codex's answer at once, each in a
  conversation of its own, while every check, every claim and the last look before each send still run one at a time
  (2 by default; more only once MQ passes on your Codex). A send whose fate cannot be known turns it off. Departs from
  0.5 and A19.

### Advanced: five more ways to go on

- **Queue for when a conversation is opened.** A usage-limited conversation the app does not have open is sent the
  ordinary continuation anyway and left in Codex's queue, for the days you choose (3 to 7); the program takes it back
  at seven days and an hour whatever it is told, and at once when this is turned off. Opened and not run within three
  minutes, it is taken back, sent the ordinary way, and this turns off. Departs from A11.
- **Continue a turn that ended with no reply.** A turn Codex completed with only your message and its reasoning in
  it - judged by the kinds of item alone, never their words - is continued once in fixed words, a run of them twice at
  most; a goal Codex keeps going or has stopped is left alone. Departs from 0.5, A13 and A26.
- **Tell a parent which of its subagents stopped.** One fixed line for each subagent that stopped on a failure, five
  at most, added to the parent's own continuation; once MS passes, a parent that finished normally is sent one too.
  Nothing is ever written to a subagent. Departs from 0.5, A15 and A26.
- **Keep a conversation going.** A conversation you pick, with a count of 1 to 10, is sent "Carry on with the next
  step of the plan." after each turn that ended well, and stops on no progress, a finished plan, an active goal, a
  failed or interrupted turn, or the count used; three at most until MK passes. Departs from A13, A26 and B9.
- **Queue messages for later.** Your own messages for one conversation, after the turn now running, at a time, or
  every day or week - in order, each once, one waiting for the one before it where you ask; paced like every recovery,
  fifteen minutes apart and five a day in one conversation (the owner's answer). Departs from A8, A17, A26, A27, C4,
  D2, H4 and H6.

### What changed for the capabilities you have

- **Cancel and Pause take back a message Codex already holds.** A message at a reset, a queued message or one of the
  edition's own continuations already in Codex's queue is taken back out of it by a Cancel or a Pause, as the program
  takes back its own; if Codex will not give it back, the row says so and it is never sent again (the owner's answer).
  A message at a reset taken back this way is cancelled; a queued message, held for you to say go on or cancel. *Send
  your own message when a limit resets* is revision 2 for it, and asks to be read again.
- **Longer messages.** *Longer reset messages* is now *Longer messages*, revision 2: it lets a queued message be up to
  8,154 characters too.
- **Three capabilities also name H2.** *Short retries when Codex is at capacity* moves A20's caps, which are the
  engine's, and *Rules for Codex's error codes* and *Retry failures it cannot name* retry failures nothing classified:
  H2 says no setting can do either, so their statements now name H2 beside the rest. Each is revision 2, and one you
  turned on turns off until you confirm its statement again.
- **An edited message is yours.** A message you edit in Codex's queue is left there, never deleted and never counted
  against the capability that sent it.
- **A watched capability's log** keeps its newest 200 lines (was 250), so every capability watched at once still fits
  inside the journal.
- **The Advanced features page lists them by importance**, the compatibility report first: then what gets work going
  again after a usage limit by itself, what saves you work, the other common failures, and last the rare cases and
  expert settings (the owner's order). A capability's warnings never move it down.

### Measured again on codex-cli 0.162.0-alpha.17.2

Every measurement was made again on the Codex in force (2026-10-10, [`docs/evidence/live/`](evidence/live/)). MW,
M1, M5, M6, M7, MA and MH passed again, M2b and MP1 to MP3 passed for the first time, and M2, M3 and M4 failed again.
What follows from it:

- **Several Codex homes** no longer say they are unmeasured on this Codex (MH).
- **The goal continuation** also acts on a conversation the app holds where M2b passed: it sets the paused goal
  active, then adds the continuation to the conversation's queue. Its statement says so at revision 2, and one you
  turned on asks to be confirmed again.
- **The panel beside the chat** passed MP1 to MP3, so the [guide](GUIDE.md#the-panel-beside-the-chat) describes it now.
- A capability whose measurement passed on this Codex shows no warning for it here; on any other version it still
  does.

### Known limits

- MQ, ME, MS, MK and MT are not measured yet, and MU, MN and MR - what the reset credit and the message at a reset
  rest on - are not settled: every capability that rests on one says so as a warning you confirm.
- The Dashboard's Pending list shows a continuation queued for opening as Codex's own queued row; it does not yet say
  that it runs when you open the conversation.

## v0.6.14 — The window no longer hangs while a recovery waits, eight more ways to recover, Keep it on, a compatibility report sent from the Dashboard, actions at a usage reset you pick, a watch log and the panel beside the chat

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.13...v0.6.14)

**From v0.6.13, it is an ordinary update.** It is the latest release, for both editions, so
v0.6.13's *Check for updates* offers it in the edition you have, and the plugin in Codex installs it
too. It was planned as the first beta of v0.6.14, the rest of the advanced edition (owner,
2026-10-07), and is published as a final instead, with what was built for that beta (owner,
2026-10-10); the rest of the advanced edition moves to v0.6.15 ([ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)). It
carries twelve new capabilities - eight that change how a recovery is made, two that act at a usage reset you pick,
Longer reset messages and the compatibility report - Keep it on for every capability, and a log of
what a watched capability would have done. Each is the advanced edition's alone, off until you turn it on in the
Dashboard's **Advanced features** page, with a statement in your language that names the standards
it departs from ([EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md#todays-capabilities)). The standard edition recovers as
v0.6.13 did; what a person sees change there is the power action's card, which now turns on and off
with a switch ([below](#the-power-actions-card-has-a-switch)), the version shown with no *Standard*
beside it ([below](#no-standard-label-beside-the-version)), and the panel in Codex, which can ask to
sit beside the chat ([below](#the-panel-beside-the-chat)). In both editions, the window no longer stops
answering while a recovery waits ([below](#the-window-no-longer-hangs-while-a-recovery-waits)).

**Going back.** The watcher's state is still schema 4, so going back to v0.6.13 takes only its setup
program or *Install another version...*. The advanced edition's own file is now version 3 - eight new
tables, for a capability's choices, the rules for Codex's error codes, which capability took up which
interruption and the samples, and for the reset actions what is counted of the usage windows, the
last reading, the reset rules and the credits spent - brought up from version 2 the first time it is
opened, every row kept. v0.6.13 cannot read version 3 and fails closed: in its advanced edition every capability is
off.

### Both editions

### The panel beside the chat

In both editions, the settings panel in Codex can sit beside a conversation, in the Codex app's right
side panel, as well as in the conversation.

- **Open beside the chat.** Where Codex can show it there, the panel's bottom bar starts with *Open
  beside the chat*, which asks Codex to move the panel to the right side panel and calls no tool. If
  Codex keeps it in the conversation, the button goes for that page and the bar says *Codex kept the
  panel here.*
- **A tab of the side panel.** The panel's tool, *Open Auto Resume settings*, offers itself to a
  conversation's side panel, where a Codex app that lists plugins' tools shows it under New tab >
  More tools.... The panel tells Codex it opens in the conversation first.
- **Read again on return.** Beside the chat, the panel reads its state again when you come back to it,
  at most once every 15 seconds and never while something is being changed there, and leaves the
  keyboard on the control it was on. It runs no timer.
- **Not measured yet.** Measurements MP1 to MP3, which say whether the Codex app shows the panel there
  as it should, are not made yet ([LIVE_ACCEPTANCE.md](LIVE_ACCEPTANCE.md)), so the guide does not
  describe the panel beside the chat until they pass.

### No Standard label beside the version

The standard edition no longer names itself beside the version (owner, 2026-10-05): the version at the
foot of the Dashboard, the Version row on its Diagnostics page and the heading of the panel in Codex
show the version alone, and the notification-area icon's tooltip shows the product's name alone. The
advanced edition still shows *Advanced* in each, and *Advanced - not loaded* where its own part could
not be loaded. *Standard* still appears where editions are told apart: where you choose one, as in
*Install another version...*, and where the installer and Diagnostics say that Codex still has the
other edition's copy of the plugin.

### The power action's card has a switch

In both editions, the power action's card in Settings > General turns on and off with the switch every
other on-or-off setting in the window is, in place of its button (owner, 2026-10-04). Turning it on
still asks first, with Cancel the default, and the switch is back off after Cancel or a refusal;
turning it off asks nothing, as Pause asks nothing. It still applies at once: Save does not change it.
The switch's line, which says what it is set to, wraps where the window is narrow rather than end in an
ellipsis, and so does the card's heading.

### The window no longer hangs while a recovery waits

**What you saw.** In both editions and in every language, while a recovery waited for a usage-limit
reset, the window stopped answering: clicks did nothing for seconds at a time, and closing and opening
it again did not help, though the watcher behind it went on recovering as it should (owner,
2026-10-10).

**Why.** The same text was measured again and again on a timer, for nothing on screen. Three things
did it, each by laying out a whole page that nobody was looking at, or that had not changed:

- Every five-second status rewrote the power action card's lines in Settings > General as visible. While
  Settings is not the page in front, a line there always reads as hidden, so the window "showed" it
  again each time and laid out the whole of Settings > General - on a PC where Windows offers no sleep,
  as on many laptops, from the first time Settings had been seen, and on every PC once a power action
  had run. History's "Turn on for this conversation" button was rewritten the same way.
- Every second, the clock wrote the Overview's "Next check in" line on every page, and each new
  countdown laid out the Overview's cards and measured every line on them - behind Pending, or in front
  for the same size.
- A switch, a conversation's line and a choice card measured their words on every question a layout
  asked them - several widths per pass, up to four passes - so each layout repeated those measurements
  thousands of times.

**What changed.** A line's visibility is written only when it really changes. The Overview's waiting
lines are written while the Overview is in front, and once more as it comes back, so it shows the
countdown of now; in front, a countdown that needs the same room as the last one is written without
laying out its card. The three controls measure each of their words once and remember the answer. In the
advanced edition, the Advanced features list, which measured every cell again every few seconds while its
page was in front, measures them again only when a row or a word changed. This changes when work happens,
never what is drawn.

**Before and after**, on the compiled window with the owner's state (one recovery waiting, sleep not
offered, a power action that has run), advanced edition, Korean, 150 %, all pages built, Pending in
front; medians of the runs:

| Each... | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| clock second | 164-168 text measurements, 3 layouts, 9.6-13.8 ms | 0 measurements, 0 layouts, 1.5-3.3 ms |
| five-second snapshot | 595-621 measurements, 8 layouts, 48-62 ms | 9 measurements, no page laid out, 0.6-2.3 ms |
| clock second, Overview in front | 168 measurements, 3 page layouts, 19.1-21.5 ms | 6 measurements, 0 layouts, 2.7-3.7 ms |
| first visit to the Overview / Settings | 7,510 / 7,692 measurements | 245 / 888 measurements |

The standard edition in English did the same: 588 measurements per snapshot and 157 per second before,
none after. Opening the window left the window unanswering for 6-20 of 39 checks before and 2-5 after.
What a first visit to a page still costs is its one layout, which this change does not touch.

**Nothing drawn changed.** Every control a person sees on every page and every Settings section - its
place, size, visibility, words, font, colours, margins and items, first shown, after twelve hidden
clock seconds, and with the Overview in front - is byte-identical before and after, in Korean and
English, at 100 % and 150 %.

### For developers

- Core gains plug point P17 (`Point.ADMISSION`): a failure core never recovers alone is put to the
  edition's plug only as core offers it (`failures.takes`), and what the plug may relax is held to
  core's own bounds (`engine/relaxed.py`, `ladder.py`). P7 also answers `EARLY`, `SEND_NOW` and
  `RESEND`, the last proven by `engine/resend.py` before core sends anything once more. The standard
  edition has no plug, so none of it runs there.
- The advanced registry knows two kinds of capability: a route answers at plug points; an action -
  the compatibility report - answers at none, so core never asks it, and has no ceilings and no
  compatibility capability. A capability's definition also says its own choices, whether the page
  shows it the rules and the samples, and whether it sends once more itself; an action is never given
  Keep it on's Send again.
- New bridge commands, the Dashboard's alone and reached by no MCP tool: `advanced-option`,
  `advanced-rules`, `advanced-rule-add`, `advanced-rule-remove`, `advanced-samples`,
  `advanced-keep-on`, `advanced-send-now`, and the report's `advanced-report-build`,
  `advanced-report-save`, `advanced-report-check`, `advanced-report-send` and `advanced-report-job`;
  then `advanced-watch-log`, and for the reset actions `advanced-resets`, `advanced-reset-add`,
  `advanced-reset-cancel`, `advanced-reset-go-on` and `advanced-credit-now`.
- Core tells the edition's plug when a conversation is switched off (`Plug.conversation_off`, not a
  plug point), so a reset message waiting there ends at once. The panel's `open_settings` declares a
  side-panel entrypoint, and its page names its display modes, inline first.
- `build/community_report.py` accepts a report the product wrote itself: `reporter.tool`
  `codex-auto-resume`, its `tool_version` its own product version, v0.6.14 or later.
- Each capability has a test module of its own under `advanced/tests/`, Keep it on one too and the
  report four; core's share is in `tests/test_plug_points.py`, `test_store.py`,
  `test_ladder_and_guards.py` and `test_failures.py`.


### Advanced edition

### Recovery the standard edition leaves for you, or makes slower

- **Short retries when Codex is at capacity.** Codex's own `serverOverloaded` is tried again about a
  minute after the failure, then two, four and five minutes, at most 48 times a day in one
  conversation, for the one to twelve hours you choose on the page (two by default). Departs from
  A20, A21, A22 and B9.
- **Rules for Codex's error codes.** Up to ten rules, each naming one of Codex's own error codes - and
  if you like a range of status numbers - and the kind of temporary failure to treat it as, for a
  failure nothing classified. Rules read codes, never the words of an error. Departs from 0.5, A13,
  A14, A26 and B9.
- **Retry failures it cannot name.** One to three tries a task on a budget of its own, ten minutes
  after the failure, then 15 and 30; each failure it takes up leaves a sample of codes, numbers and
  times only. Departs from 0.5, A13, A14, A26, B9 and D2.
- **Retry when Codex gave up.** `responseTooManyFailedAttempts` after a server error or none, ten
  minutes later and then 15, twice a task at most. Departs from A14, A26 and B9.
- **Retry a sign-in failure after proof.** Once a task, at least ten minutes later, and only once the
  usage read every continuation needs shows Codex is signed in again. Codex's sign-in is never read or
  changed, and a permission refusal (403) is never retried. Departs from 0.5, A14 and A26.
- **Notice a usage limit that lifts early.** While a conversation waits for a usage limit to reset, it
  asks Codex every five minutes whether usage is available, and two yeses five minutes apart continue
  it before the reset time Codex gave. Departs from A12 and C9.

The four that take up a failure the standard edition leaves for you - the rules, failures it cannot
name, Codex giving up and a sign-in failure - take up only failures from the last hour, none from
before they were turned on or watched, and the program ends such a recovery unsent a day on the
clock after the failure.

### Once more when unsure, and Send now

- **Once more when unsure.** A continuation whose arrival cannot be proven is sent once more, with the
  same marker, between 15 minutes and 6 hours after the first - only if Codex was never seen holding
  it, neither its history nor its queue holds the marker, the conversation has nothing later and every
  check a send passes still holds. Found twice, it turns itself off. Departs from 0.2, A6, E2 and H2.
- **Send now.** While it is on, the page lists the recoveries waiting now, each with *Send now...*: the
  watcher sends the one you choose at its next look, past its wait, a postponement, the 15 minutes
  between two continuations and an attempt budget of your own - never past a usage limit, quiet hours,
  an administrator's limit, five continuations a day or any other check. Departs from A8, A20, A21
  and H2.

### Keep it on

A capability that is on or watched can be kept on, after its own warning. Kept on, it no longer turns
itself off for a tripwire or a new version of Codex: the page notes the most serious of them under
its state until you turn it on again, and a part of it that fails skips only that one recovery. Its
ceilings stay, turning it off - in the Dashboard, from Codex or with every advanced feature at once -
always works, and an administrator's policy reads it down as any other capability (K8). A capability
kept on that sends continuations can also *Also send again when unsure*, under Once more when
unsure's rules and only where the policy allows that one too.

### The compatibility report

**Compatibility report** is the first capability that is an *action*: it answers at no point of a
recovery, sends nothing to Codex and spends nothing - a person starts what it does, in the Dashboard's
**Advanced features** page. Off until you turn it on or watch it, as every capability is.

- **Watched**, it writes the report codex-compat-reporter writes, from this PC's own records - counts,
  states and times for the version of Codex in use, read read-only, the same records left out - and
  shows the whole file with its SHA-256, its records, its verdict and its size; *Save the file...*
  saves it wherever you choose, never over a file. GitHub is asked nothing.
- **On**, *Check what sending would write* also asks GitHub, through gh - the GitHub CLI you
  installed, signed in as you - and lists every write: the fork, the branch, the one commit adding
  exactly that file, and the public pull request. *Send* works only once you have typed `send` in its
  box, exactly, and sends exactly the file and the writes shown, which it reads again from GitHub
  first. Without gh, or with gh signed in as someone else, the card shows the four steps to send it on
  the web instead, with the names to type as text you can select; it opens nothing itself.
- **A pause stops it.** While recovery is paused nothing is checked or sent; writing and saving
  still work. A send in progress stops before its next write when the capability is turned off, an
  administrator's policy forbids it or recovery is paused, and the card shows what was written.
- **One at a time.** One check or send runs at a time for an installation, whichever Dashboard window
  started it. Every gh runs in a job that ends with the Dashboard's service, and one that has not
  answered in two minutes is ended. A send cut off - the window closed, the network lost - shows as
  lost; checking again reads what is on GitHub, recognises a pull request of that very file as sent
  already, and sending again is safe.
- **Departs from** B11, C1, C2, C3, C8, D1, E8, F3 and F6, each named in its statement; it keeps G13
  - a report grants nothing - and K5. No MCP tool reaches it. The project's check accepts a report the
  product wrote itself (`reporter.tool` `codex-auto-resume`, product v0.6.14 or later).

[EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md) describes it, and [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) says what it sends to GitHub.

### What a watched capability would have done

- **On its page.** A capability set to *Watch first* shows, in a card last in its column on the
  **Advanced features** page, what it would have done over the last 30 days: since when it is
  watched, and one line for each answer, in words - how many times, once for each recovery it would
  have acted on, and when last. Until it is asked anything it would have acted on, the card says so,
  and it says that watching does nothing. An action, which is never asked anything, has no such card.
- **What is kept.** The advanced journal keeps at most the newest 250 of these lines a capability, so
  one busy capability never pushes another's out, and the journal's own bound of 5,000 lines cuts
  every other line before them. Where the bound let older answers of the 30 days go, the card says
  from when it counts.
- **In a diagnostics export.** An export you ask for adds, for each capability watched or with answers
  in the last 30 days, its id, since when it is watched, each answer's word, where it was asked, how
  many times, the first and last minute, from when it counts and whether older answers were cut - no
  conversation's or interruption's id. The status and the notification-area icon never carry it.

### At a usage reset you pick

Three new capabilities act at a usage reset, not at a failure. Each is set on the **Advanced
features** page while it is on, and Pending shows each rule still waiting under **Scheduled**, with
Cancel - and *Go on counting* for one held - but never the words of a message. While a rule waits,
it reads usage every 15 minutes, at most once in five minutes, and counts each window's fills and
resets itself, from the first reading after the rule was added. If this PC is off or recovery is
paused for longer than the window, the rule is held until you say *Go on counting* or cancel it.

- **Use a reset credit at the limit you pick.** You pick the next time the 5-hour limit is reached, a
  later time up to nine from now, or the next weekly limit, once or every time, and whether it asks
  you first. When that limit is reached while a recovery waits for usage, it uses one of your reset
  credits so the recovery can go on, after reading usage again: the window must still be full, a
  recovery must still be waiting, and the count of credits and the soonest expiry must both be
  readable. Until measurement MR has passed on your version of Codex it never spends on its own: the
  rule waits for you to press *Use a reset credit now...*, which the page also offers whenever a limit
  is reached, and a click too spends only while a recovery waits. At most one credit for one filling
  of a window, two a day and seven a week; never while recovery is paused, in Observe only or in quiet
  hours; a spend whose result cannot be known turns it off. Departs from A12, B3, B4, B10, C4 and C9.
- **Send your own message when a limit resets.** You write a message of your own, up to 2,000
  characters, for one conversation that is switched on, and pick the reset it goes at: the 5-hour
  limit's next, a later one up to nine from now, or the weekly limit's next. At that reset it is sent
  once, as you wrote it, with its marker after a blank line, through every check a continuation
  passes. When a recovery in that conversation waits for the same reset, only your message is sent,
  in its place; the recovery waits for it up to 30 minutes after the reset, and then goes on. One
  message may wait for a conversation and ten in all; switching its conversation off cancels it, and
  its words are kept only until it is sent, cancelled or ended. Departs from A8, A17, A26, C4, C9, D2,
  H4 and H6; it keeps A27 and H5.
- **Longer reset messages.** An action that sends nothing: while it is on, a message for a reset may
  be up to 8,154 characters, the most one continuation can carry, instead of 2,000. Turned off, every
  waiting message longer than 2,000 characters is cancelled. Departs from A27 alone.

The measurements the two reset actions rest on - MU, MN and MR - are not made yet. Until they are
made on your version of Codex, each statement carries them as warnings, the form says that the count
past the next reset is unproven, and a credit is spent only when you press *Use a reset credit
now...*. [EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md#use-a-reset-credit-at-the-limit-you-pick) describes each.

## v0.6.13 — Codex's engine found again, wherever an update puts it

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.12...v0.6.13)

**What changed since v0.6.12, in one place.** For a person, one fix, in both editions: the watcher
finds Codex's engine again after a Codex update moves it, where v0.6.12 went on looking at the old
path and every recovery waited until the watcher restarted. The pre-release v0.6.13-beta carried it
first, and everything it announced is below. The final adds the two cases
the beta left open - the ChatGPT app running its Codex server from another build while the old one
stays on disk, and two builds that both pass the engine checks ([Fixes](#fixes)) - and, besides,
only compatibility data 6 to 8.

**From v0.6.12 or v0.6.13-beta, it is an ordinary update.** It is the latest release, for both
editions, so v0.6.12's *Check for updates* offers it in the edition you have, and so does
v0.6.13-beta's; the plugin in Codex installs it too. Settings, a pause, everything waiting and the
sign-in choice are kept, and nothing is converted: the watcher's state is still schema 4 and the
advanced edition's own file still version 2. Windows is asked nothing new: the list of running
ChatGPT and Codex processes the watcher already reads - each one's id, parent and executable path -
now also tells it which engine the app runs its Codex server from ([PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md)). Going
back to v0.6.13-beta or v0.6.12 takes only its setup program, or *Install another version...*.

**If recoveries have waited since a Codex update** - with *Why it is waiting* saying the ChatGPT app
or its Codex server is not running while it was, or with no engine chosen because two Codex builds
passed the engine checks - this release sends them, without a restart of the watcher and without an
engine named by hand. Nothing was sent twice or to another conversation: they only waited. One still
waiting when you update is sent by the new watcher once it passes the checks every recovery passes.

**Every plugin copy from v0.6.0's on reads this version.** `0.6.13` has no word after its three
numbers, and every bootstrap published from v0.6.0 on compares those, so none of them takes this
installation for none.

### Fixes

- **An update that moves Codex's engine no longer stops recovery.** The watcher found `codex.exe`
  once, when it started, and never looked again. On 2026-10-07 the Codex app (26.930) updated, put its
  engine in a new folder under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\bin` and emptied the old one; from then
  on the watcher looked for the app's server at the old path, found none, and every recovery waited,
  saying the ChatGPT app or its Codex server was not running, until the watcher was restarted - at the
  next sign-in, for most people. Now, before each check, the watcher sees whether the file it found
  is still there and unchanged (its size and write time); when it is gone or another file stands in
  its place, it looks for the engine again and runs every engine check again, as at the start.
  Nothing was sent twice or to another conversation; recoveries waited.
- **Nor does an update that runs the app's server from another build.** An update can start the
  ChatGPT app's Codex server from a build in another `bin\<hash>` folder and leave the old build on
  disk, unchanged. The beta then kept the old file, looked for the app's server there, found none, and
  every recovery waited, saying the ChatGPT app or its Codex server was not running. Now, where the
  one ChatGPT app runs `codex.exe` children none of which is the file the watcher holds, the watcher
  notes their paths, and before its next check looks for the engine again, every check included,
  when one of them is an official engine. It does so at once for each change. A build that then fails
  its checks - as it can while the update is still writing it - is tried again after a minute, then
  twice as long each time, up to every 15 minutes: not on every check, and with no restart needed
  once it passes. It reads the same list of processes, paths and parents, nothing else, and its log
  line names no path.
- **Of two builds that pass the engine checks, the one the app runs is driven.** With the old folder
  kept beside the new one, both builds can pass, and the watcher refused that as ambiguous until an
  engine was named by hand, so every recovery waited meanwhile. Now, where more than one official
  build passes, it asks which of them the one ChatGPT app runs as its Codex server, and drives that
  build if exactly one of them is; none, several, no app or two of them, or a question that fails is
  the refusal it always was. The compatibility status read without a watcher chooses the same way.
  An engine named by `--codex-exe`, the `codex_exe` setting or the environment is used as named, and
  the app is not asked. [The guide](GUIDE.md#requirements) says when the watcher looks again and
  which build it drives.

### Compatibility data

- The bundled data names codex-cli 0.159.0-alpha.12.1 (compatibility data 6) and codex-cli 0.160.0,
  verified (data 7 and 8), as v0.6.13-beta's did; v0.6.12 carried data 5.

### For developers

- `tests/test_engine_moved.py`: the same file is not looked for again; an engine moved to another
  folder is found there; another file at the same path is checked again; none left is refused, never
  kept; the loop asks before every tick but its first. All five fail with the fix reverted. They have
  a module of their own because `tests/test_compat_characterization.py` must stay v0.6.10's file for
  `test_released_calls`.
- Two tests no longer use a real Codex version as one no data names (`codex-cli 99.0.0`, `99.1.0`), so a
  new compatibility document cannot break them, as data 7 did.
- `config.discover_codex_exe` takes `running`, asked only where more than one official build passes:
  the image paths the one ChatGPT app main runs as its `codex.exe` children (`pairing.app_engines`),
  matched case-insensitively. `compat/probes.discover` passes it as the watcher does.
- `Backend.app_identity` keeps, where the pairing is refused, the paths of the app main's `codex.exe`
  children if none of them is the held path (`pairing.engines_instead`), and `App.engine_moved` drops
  the backend before the next tick when they include an official engine
  (`config.candidate_codex_exes`), remembering that set with each file's size and write time, so that
  each change is acted on at once and, while it stands, again on the monotonic clock after
  `ELSEWHERE_FIRST_WAIT` (60 s), doubling up to `ELSEWHERE_LONGEST_WAIT` (15 minutes).
- `tests/test_engine_moved.py` gains `ServedElsewhereTests` and `TwoThatPassTests`. With the changes
  reverted, every one of them fails: each guard's test ends on the case that does look again or
  choose, so none passes only because nothing ever looks. Each guard was also reverted alone, and
  each made its test fail.

## v0.6.13-beta — The watcher finds Codex's engine again after an update moves it

[The commits in this pre-release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.12...v0.6.13-beta)

**A pre-release with one fix, for both editions, published from `main`.** It is a GitHub
pre-release, so `releases/latest` stays v0.6.12; an installation of v0.6.12 is offered it by *Check
for updates*, which asks first and says it is tested less, and *Install another version...* lists it.
The final v0.6.13 follows it, improved further (owner, 2026-10-07).

### Fixes

- **An update that moves Codex's engine no longer stops recovery.** The watcher found `codex.exe`
  once, when it started, and never looked again. On 2026-10-07 the Codex app (26.930) updated, put its
  engine in a new folder under `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\bin` and emptied the old one; from then
  on the watcher looked for the app's server at the old path, found none, and every recovery waited,
  saying the ChatGPT app or its Codex server was not running, until the watcher was restarted - at the
  next sign-in, for most people. Now, before each check, the watcher sees whether the file it found
  is still there and unchanged (its size and write time); when it is gone or another file stands in
  its place, it looks for the engine again and runs every engine check again, as at the start.
  Nothing was sent twice or to another conversation; recoveries waited.

### Compatibility data

- The bundled data now names codex-cli 0.159.0-alpha.12.1 (compatibility data 6) and codex-cli
  0.160.0, verified (data 7 and 8).

### For developers

- `tests/test_engine_moved.py`: the same file is not looked for again; an engine moved to another
  folder is found there; another file at the same path is checked again; none left is refused, never
  kept; the loop asks before every tick but its first. All five fail with the fix reverted. They have
  a module of their own because `tests/test_compat_characterization.py` must stay v0.6.10's file for
  `test_released_calls`.
- Two tests no longer use a real Codex version as one no data names (`codex-cli 99.0.0`, `99.1.0`), so a
  new compatibility document cannot break them, as data 7 did.


## v0.6.12 — Another version from the Dashboard, a power action after usage limits, and recovery beside the Codex app's cloud-environment server


[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.11...v0.6.12)

**What changed since v0.6.11, in one place.** For a person, two additions and two fixes. In the
Dashboard, *Install another version...* installs any version from v0.6.2 on, of either edition,
pre-releases too ([below](#install-another-version)) - asked for by the owner on 2026-09-28. A power
action can sleep, hibernate or shut down the PC once usage-limit recoveries finish, off until you
turn it on ([below](#the-power-action-after-usage-limit-recoveries)) - asked for in Discussion #22.
Both are in the standard edition, and in both editions' windows. The fixes: recovery beside the
Codex app's cloud-environment server, without which no recovery was sent with the Codex app from
26.930 on, and a setup program that removes its folder when its console window is closed
([Fixes](#fixes)). Two pre-releases for the people who build the project came first, v0.6.12-alpha (the test suite in parts and pictures taken when the window is ready) and v0.6.12-alpha.2 (every lane's test parts even); nothing in them changes anything for a person, and everything they announced is under *For developers* below. The additions and the fixes were not published as a pre-release first.

**From v0.6.11, it is an ordinary update.** It is the latest release, so v0.6.11's *Check for
updates* offers it in the edition you have, and so does a v0.6.12 pre-release's; the plugin in
Codex installs it too. Settings, a pause, everything waiting and the sign-in choice are kept, and
nothing is converted: the watcher's state is still schema 4 and the advanced edition's own file
still version 2. The picker and the power action do nothing until you use them, so at its
defaults either edition does what v0.6.11 did, but for the fixes. Besides a new button and a new
card, what changes is three content-free questions to Windows: whether this account may shut down
and which sleep states the PC offers, asked each time the Dashboard shows that card, and - only
where the Codex app runs more than one `codex.exe` of the configured engine - which of them holds
Codex's queue or state database open, asked of the Restart Manager for the pairing fix
([PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md)). Going back to v0.6.11 takes only its setup program, or *Install another
version...* ([below](#going-back-from-v0612)). Coming from a version before v0.6.11, v0.6.11's entry
says what the update converts ([The state, and going back](CHANGELOG.md#the-state-and-going-back)).

**If recoveries have waited since the Codex app 26.930**, with *Why it is waiting* saying the Codex
app is not running while it was, this is the release that sends them. Nothing was sent twice or to
another conversation: they only waited. One still waiting when you update is sent by the new
watcher once it passes the checks every recovery passes.

**Every plugin copy from v0.6.0's on reads this version.** `0.6.12` has no word after its three
numbers, and every bootstrap published from v0.6.0 on compares those, so none of them takes this
installation for none. Only a pre-release's word needs a later copy: v0.6.12-alpha's needs v0.6.9-alpha's or later, and v0.6.12-alpha.2's needs v0.6.11-beta.2's or later; if yours is older, set up and repair with the installation's own copy, `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume\app\scripts\bootstrap.ps1`.


### Install another version...

- **Any version, either edition, from the Dashboard.** *Install another version...*, appended last
  to the Diagnostics page's Tools card so no button moves, opens a list of every version from v0.6.2
  on in each edition it was published in (the advanced edition from v0.6.11-alpha), newest first,
  and installs the row you confirm in place of the installation the window belongs to. A row it
  cannot install stays in the list, greyed, with its reason: the version you have, no archive of that
  edition under that number, no checksum to check it against, an installer that predates editions
  (from the advanced edition, a standard version before v0.6.11-alpha), or your administrator's
  policy that version would not keep. Versions before v0.6.2 are not offered: from v0.6.0 and v0.6.1
  the Dashboard cannot check a download, and v0.5's installers do not keep a paused recovery paused. [The guide](GUIDE.md#installing-another-version) says the rest.
- **Pre-releases too, older and newer.** Pre-releases are offered as releases are, in both editions:
  one picked by name and confirmed is installed as a release would be, an older one only with
  `-Force`, which the confirmation passes. The owner amended I12 for it on 2026-10-03: its two
  pre-release clauses bind what *Check for updates* offers, which is still the newest pre-release
  newer than both the version you have and the newest release.
- **Asked first, and only what applies.** The confirmation is the careful one (*Not now* is what Enter
  and Escape press) and says only what applies: a pre-release is tested less; an older version lacks
  what came since, and a setting or value it does not know reads as its default there; the state is
  converted first, and what that switches off; a change of edition takes the advanced features away or
  starts every one of them off; an advanced version before v0.6.11-beta.2 cannot read this version's
  advanced settings; and the download is checked before anything runs.
- **Converted only after the archive passed.** Confirming reads the list again - a row no longer
  offered as it was shown installs nothing - then downloads the archive, checks it against its pin or
  its published `.sha256`, tests and unpacks it as every install does, and only then takes the
  install lock. For a version from v0.6.2 to v0.6.11-alpha, which reads a state one schema older, the
  installed version's own `downgrade-state --to 3 --stop-watcher` then asks the watcher to stop,
  waits a minute at most, never kills it, and converts the state as `downgrade-state --to 3` always
  has, with a copy beside it: what may already have gone to Codex becomes final and is never sent
  again, and what could be sent twice is switched off. Then that version's own installer runs. The
  result says whether the watcher changed hands and what the conversion switched off, by count.
- **Start watcher waits too.** While an action of the Diagnostics page runs - this one or *Check
  for updates* - the header's *Start watcher* is greyed with every other action button, so the window
  cannot start the current watcher between a conversion and the installer.
- **Nothing that reads the state puts it back.** While an installation holds its lock, the window,
  the panel, Codex's tools and the command line read an older state as an older watcher's and never
  upgrade it, so neither the Dashboard's own refresh, every five seconds, nor a notification's
  *Cancel* pressed meanwhile, nor a status asked from Codex's skill or the Start Menu can bring a
  converted state back to this version's schema before the older version's installer has run. An
  installer's own setup switches through that older store, and the watcher it starts upgrades the
  state, as a watcher always has. Once no installation holds the lock this version upgrades the state
  again - except in a window or an MCP server left open from before the pick: once the older
  version's installer has replaced the files they run from, they leave the state to that version.
- **Nor does anything start the watcher meanwhile.** While an installation holds its lock, the
  bridge's `start-watcher`, which the window's *Start watcher* sends, and Codex's `start_watcher` tool
  start nothing and refuse with `start_failed` and the reason, as the start with Codex always has, so
  no caller of either can start this version's watcher between a conversion and the installer.
- **An administrator's policy is kept.** `DisableUpdateCheck` greys this button with *Check for
  updates*. While any policy value an older version would stop applying is set - every one but
  `DisablePowerAction`, which holds back what no older version has - or a policy key cannot be read,
  no version before v0.6.11-beta - the first that reads them - is offered or picked.
- **Privacy.** The list is read from one more api.github.com address, the same list of releases on
  the same path, thirty to a page and at most five pages, only when you press the button and again
  when you confirm; then only the version you confirmed is downloaded. The policy keys are read on
  this PC, read only, and the answer goes nowhere. Nothing is sent to Codex.

### The power action after usage-limit recoveries

Asked for in Discussion #22, and decided by the owner on 2026-09-30 and 2026-10-03. It is in the
standard edition: it keeps every standard, with A28 amended by the owner for its stop button (suggested by
[@cervinho](https://github.com/cervinho), [#22](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/discussions/22)).

- **Off by default, turned on only in the Dashboard.** Settings > General has a new last card, **When
  usage-limit recoveries finish**: Then (Sleep, Hibernate or Shut down), When (every recovery succeeded;
  each one succeeded or was handed over to you; each one ended, however it ended), How often (once, for
  the next usage limit, or every time) and Warn me first for (2 to 30 minutes). **Turn on...** asks
  first, with Cancel as the default. The card is not a setting: Save never changes it, and nothing
  else moves on the page. A Once that no usage limit reaches within a day turns itself off.
- **Only after usage-limit recoveries, and only when nothing else runs.** A recovery from a temporary
  error never starts or decides it, though while one is open it holds it. The watcher acts only when
  every usage-limit recovery of its batch has ended as chosen, no recovery waits, runs or may still be
  delivered, Codex has finished recording every conversation written in the last hour, no turn runs
  and no input is queued in Codex, nobody else is signed in (for a shut down), and nobody has used the
  PC for 2 minutes. Anything it cannot read means it waits, and the card says what it waits for.
- **A countdown with a stop button.** A notification says when it will happen, with **Don't sleep**
  (or Don't hibernate, Don't shut down) and **Open Dashboard**. The stop, from the toast or the card,
  is read before anything else, ends that batch, and never starts another countdown; it names its batch
  by an opaque id that every batch end replaces, so an old notice cannot stop the next one. Any input,
  a pause, a gap in the watcher's looks or a new recovery ends the countdown too. The power notices are
  shown whatever the notification switches say.
- **Turned off from anywhere, turned on from nowhere else.** The card's **Turn off**, a new item in the
  notification-area icon's menu while it is on, and a new MCP tool, `turn_off_power_action`, which is
  not marked destructive, as pause is not. No tool turns it on. Pausing recovery holds it and ends a
  countdown but does not turn it off: once recovery is resumed it acts as before.
- **Windows' own calls, from the watcher.** SetSuspendState, or ExitWindowsEx(EWX_POWEROFF) with no
  force flag, after the watcher enables SeShutdownPrivilege on its own token; an account without that
  privilege is offered nothing. No process, task, service or administrator, no Windows setting changed
  (Hibernate is never turned on), the two libraries loaded from System32 only, and no shut down while
  someone else is signed in. The batch is recorded as done before Windows is asked, so a refusal is
  said once and never tried again.
- **A file of its own.** `config\power-action.json` holds ids, times and closed words, is read
  strictly (anything else reads as off) and is written under a lock. There is no new setting and no
  new database schema, so the version picker's older versions simply ignore it. Uninstall keeps it;
  a purge removes it. `get_status` and the diagnostics export carry its state only while the file
  exists.
- **For administrators**, a seventh policy value, `DisablePowerAction`, holds it and greys the card:
  it cannot be turned on, and one turned on before stays and does nothing until the value is removed.
- **Standards.** H14 (the power action's rule) and F15 (its Windows calls) are new; A28 is amended for
  the stop button (by the owner, 2026-10-03); B16 names the three questions it asks Windows; H8's
  unmarked tools include `turn_off_power_action`.
- **Not yet called for real.** Every part is unit- and integration-tested with Windows stood in, and
  the product refuses to act while a test runs. No running watcher has yet put a PC to sleep,
  hibernated or shut one down; the owner's measurement MP, at live acceptance, does that first, and
  until then Sleep is offered only where Windows reports S1 to S3.

### Going back from v0.6.12

- **The state and the advanced edition's file are v0.6.11's.** `state.sqlite` is still schema 4 and
  `config\advanced\advanced.sqlite` still version 2, so going back to v0.6.12-alpha.2, v0.6.12-alpha
  or v0.6.11 takes only its setup program or `Install.cmd`, in the edition you have. *Install another
  version...* goes back too, and for a version from v0.6.2 to v0.6.11-alpha converts the state first,
  as above; by hand, going back that far is as v0.6.11's entry says
  ([The state, and going back](CHANGELOG.md#the-state-and-going-back)).
- **The power action's file.** `config\power-action.json` is this version's alone: an older version
  leaves it as it is and never acts on it, and this version or a later one reads it again as it was
  left.

### Fixes

- **The Codex app's own server is found beside its cloud-environment server.** The Codex app from
  26.930 on can start a cloud-environment server (`codex.exe exec-server`) beside its own app server,
  from the same binary, and then no recovery was sent: each one waited, saying the Codex app was not
  running, because the watcher took a `codex.exe` the app started as the app's own server only when
  it was the only one. Where the app has more than one of the configured engine, the watcher now asks
  Windows' Restart Manager - as it already does to see which conversation the app holds - which of
  them holds Codex's queue or state database open, both in one question, and takes that one. If
  Windows cannot say, or none or more than one does, it waits as before. It reads no command line
  and no process memory, and an app with one server is read exactly as before.
  [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) names the question.
- **The setup program removes its folder when its console window is closed.** Closing the window
  just as Install.cmd ended could leave the whole unpacked archive in %TEMP%: taking away a Ctrl+C
  handler waited for the close handler, which waited for the folder to be removed, until Windows
  ended the program. The close handler is now the program's only handler, added once and never taken
  away, and it answers Ctrl+C and Ctrl+Break from Install.cmd's start on.

### For developers

#### The version picker, the pairing fix and the power action

- `scripts/bootstrap.ps1` gains `-Versions` (lists, exit 0, or `versions: unavailable`, exit 12) and
  `-Pick <version> -Edition <edition> [-Force]` (installs one offered row; refusals exit 15).
  `scripts/release.json` gains `release_pages`. `downgrade-state` gains `--stop-watcher`, with its
  one-line answer and exit 3 for a watcher that did not stop; `scripts/plugin_setup.py` passes it
  through for `--to 3`. The window's one start of the bootstrap is now `StartBootstrap`.
- New tests: `tests/test_version_picker.py`, `tests/test_gui_versions.py`, and in
  `tests/test_downgrade.py` the stop-watcher tests, the floor's proof against the tags and the reads
  under the install lock. The privacy test's api.github.com allowance is widened, deliberately, to
  exactly the two addresses of the list of releases, and each privacy summary names the picker.
- Every CI test part uploads its seconds per file as an artifact (`scripts/test_parts.py --seconds`),
  and `--merge-seconds` folds a downloaded run into `tests/data/durations.json` by `--record-durations`'
  rules, so the durations no longer come from parsing job logs.
- The pairing's tests: `tests/test_windows.py`'s `SeveralEngineChildrenTests` (the Restart Manager's
  holder among several children of the configured engine, and every way short of exactly one that
  fails closed) and `tests/test_engine_children.py` (the app gate through the real transport against
  codexsim, where the app runs two of the configured engine).
- The power action's tests: `tests/test_power_action.py`, `test_power_action_control.py`,
  `test_power_action_watcher.py`, `test_power_action_windows.py` and `test_gui_power_action.py`, with
  additions in `test_cli`, `test_notify`, `test_notice_card`, `test_source`, `test_tray`, `test_mcp`
  and `test_managed`. The product refuses the real power calls while `unittest` is loaded.

#### The suite in parts

- **One place splits the suite, by measured time.** `scripts/test_parts.py` deals the test files
  into parts balanced by how long each took on that lane when it was last measured (`tests/data/durations.json`, a table for each lane),
  and runs each part as `unittest discover` runs the suite: the same files, loaded by discover
  itself, in the same order, with a fresh Python for each suite. Every CI lane, the suite the release
  runs before it builds, and the ko sync now run it in four parts, a job each; a lane took 78 to 103
  minutes as one job. `tests/test_split_runs.py` proves that the parts together are exactly the
  tests discover finds, each once.
- **Proven to give a whole run's results.** On the owner's PC each lane was run whole - `unittest
  discover` itself - and in four parts, and the two were compared test by test. Of the tests that
  ran both ways, 4,268 of the standard lane's 4,274 and 4,595 of the advanced lane's 4,596 came out
  the same. All but five of the differences were a probe that ran out of time or a check sensitive
  to timing, under the load of four parts and other work on one PC, and each passes alone, both
  ways. The five were a real leak, now fixed: `tests/test_gui_own_values.py` set the process's
  interface language to English and never gave it back, and `tests/test_locale.py` passed in a whole
  run only because `tests/test_l10n.py` ran between them and reset it. Dealt into different parts,
  five of its tests - 30 checks - failed. The window tests give the language back when they end now,
  and that part, run again, came out as the whole run did in every test.
- **Parts run at once on one PC are not a whole run.** They contend for one desktop and one
  processor, which CI's parts - a runner each - never do. `--compare` names the part each differing
  test ran in, prints the command that runs that part alone, and holds it to the whole run; the
  contributing guide says what it means when they then agree, and when they still differ
  ([In parts](CONTRIBUTING.md#in-parts)). On that PC, under its load, four parts at once took about
  half the time: the standard lane 60 minutes against 123.
- **A CI lane sees the tree as `main` does.** On `dev` and pull requests into it, the `main-tree`
  job takes every Korean document off the tree, as a promotion to `main` does, and runs the
  release's suite on what is left. A test that reads a Korean page without asking whether the
  checkout holds one now fails on `dev`, before it reaches `main`.

#### Every lane's parts even

- **Each lane is dealt by its own times.** v0.6.12-alpha dealt every CI lane's test files into its
  four parts by one table: each file's median over all the lanes of one CI run. A file does not take
  every lane as long - `tests/test_neutral_plug.py` took 1,305 s in the advanced lane, where the
  advanced package sits beside core, and 841 s in the standard one - so on a later CI run of `dev` the
  standard lane's parts took 19 to 29 minutes, the `main-tree` job's (the release's lane on `main`'s
  tree) 22 to 28, and the advanced lane's 21 to 41, its first part the heavy one.
  `tests/data/durations.json` now holds a table for each lane: each file's median over that lane's
  jobs in two of `dev`'s CI runs on GitHub's runners, read from the job logs. `scripts/test_parts.py`
  deals a lane by its own table, a file that table lacks by the figure for every lane, which stays,
  and a file measured nowhere round-robin after the rest, as before. Every workflow already names its
  lane, so none of them changed.
- **Before and after, by those tables.** Dealt by the one table, the four parts of each lane come to
  20 to 24 minutes in the standard lane, 24 to 30 in the advanced and 22 to 32 in the release lane, up
  to 1.45 times apart, by the lane's own table; measured, the release lane's parts were closer than
  that table says: 22 to 28 minutes on `dev` and 21 to 23 in v0.6.12-alpha's release run. Dealt by
  its own table, each lane's parts are within a second of each other, at 21.4, 26.8 and 24.9 minutes.
  `tests/test_split_runs.py` now holds every lane's parts, by its own table, within 1.2 times of each
  other at the count the workflows use, which the one table's deal fails in all three lanes; the parts
  together are still exactly the tests `unittest discover` finds, each once, in every lane and every
  count from one to eight.
- **`--record-durations` writes the lane it ran.** It keeps that table's other files and the other
  lanes' tables, and gives the figure for every lane to a file that had none, so the other lanes deal
  it by a measurement too. `--list --parts 4 --lane advanced` shows a lane's deal.

#### Faster pictures

- **A window is photographed when it says it may be.** The picture generator photographed each
  window a fixed fifteen seconds after it started, whatever it was doing by then. Now the window
  sets an event once the page it opened on is drawn from every answer it asked for and holds still -
  nothing on its way from the bridge, nothing gliding, and a tick of its clock since - and
  `build/capture_window.ps1` waits for that, with the fifteen seconds as its limit. None of these
  windows takes the foreground, and a picture whose caption still comes out active is taken again.
- **Only stale pictures are drawn.** A run draws only the pictures whose inputs moved, whose files
  are not the bytes the manifest records, or that were captured at another display scaling, each
  job in a process of its own, side by side; `--all` draws every one. Measured on the owner's PC
  while other work ran, a full run took 1,144 s and `--breathe` 126 s before, and 479 s and 30 s
  after, with two windows at a time; with nothing stale, 7 s.
- **One window at a time, unless `--windows N` asks for more.** A session once crashed while
  several windows were being captured at once, so more than one is a trial a person asks for.
- **A window being photographed answers no pointer.** Windows hands a window that appears under a
  pointer standing still a mouse move of its own, so a control under a mouse somebody had left there
  was drawn hovered: v0.6.11-beta.3's Settings pictures show the Custom message card hovered, and
  pictures made twice differed by where the mouse had been. A window the generator starts now drops
  the mouse's moves, presses, wheel turns, hover and leave before any control sees them; a person's
  window answers the mouse as always.
- **History's clock is pinned.** The window's pictures print every date and time as one moment, the
  popup's and the panel's, in UTC. History is drawn again byte for byte on another day and in
  another time zone, where it printed the day the pictures were made.

How it was checked: in a scratch copy, against the generator before it, 63 of 67 pictures came out
byte for byte the same, and the other four differed only in History's times of day, which two runs
of the old generator also differ in. A second comparison found seven pictures that differed where
nothing should have, and in each the old generator's window had had the pointer over it - the case
the change above closes.

## v0.6.12-alpha.2 — Every lane's test parts even, each dealt by its own times

[The commits in this pre-release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.12-alpha...v0.6.12-alpha.2)

**A pre-release for developers, published from `main`.** It is a GitHub pre-release, so
`releases/latest` never answers with it, and the plugin's own route installs what `main`'s manifest
says, so an installation made that way gets it. An installation of v0.6.11 or v0.6.12-alpha is
offered it by *Check for updates*, which asks first and says it is tested less; what the older ones
are offered is in v0.6.12-alpha's entry, below. It is v0.6.12-alpha with one change to how this
project splits its tests, which the owner asked for on 2026-10-03, so it is an alpha too. **Nothing
changes for a person using it.** Both editions do what v0.6.12-alpha does, say and draw what it says
and draws, and make the same calls to Codex; what changed is a developer's tool and the times it
reads. Going back takes only v0.6.12-alpha's or v0.6.11's setup program
([below](#going-back-from-v0612-alpha2)).

**A plugin copy older than v0.6.11-beta.2's cannot read this version.** The bootstraps published
from v0.6.0 to v0.6.11-beta read no number after `-alpha`, so none of them can compare
`0.6.12-alpha.2` with anything; v0.6.11-beta.2's copy and every later one read it. Set up and repair
with the installation's own copy, `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume\app\scripts\bootstrap.ps1`, or
with a plugin at v0.6.11-beta.2 or later.

### Every lane's parts even

- **Each lane is dealt by its own times.** v0.6.12-alpha dealt every CI lane's test files into its
  four parts by one table: each file's median over all the lanes of one CI run. A file does not take
  every lane as long - `tests/test_neutral_plug.py` took 1,305 s in the advanced lane, where the
  advanced package sits beside core, and 841 s in the standard one - so on a later CI run of `dev` the
  standard lane's parts took 19 to 29 minutes, the `main-tree` job's (the release's lane on `main`'s
  tree) 22 to 28, and the advanced lane's 21 to 41, its first part the heavy one.
  `tests/data/durations.json` now holds a table for each lane: each file's median over that lane's
  jobs in two of `dev`'s CI runs on GitHub's runners, read from the job logs. `scripts/test_parts.py`
  deals a lane by its own table, a file that table lacks by the figure for every lane, which stays,
  and a file measured nowhere round-robin after the rest, as before. Every workflow already names its
  lane, so none of them changed.
- **Before and after, by those tables.** Dealt by the one table, the four parts of each lane come to
  20 to 24 minutes in the standard lane, 24 to 30 in the advanced and 22 to 32 in the release lane, up
  to 1.45 times apart, by the lane's own table; measured, the release lane's parts were closer than
  that table says: 22 to 28 minutes on `dev` and 21 to 23 in v0.6.12-alpha's release run. Dealt by
  its own table, each lane's parts are within a second of each other, at 21.4, 26.8 and 24.9 minutes.
  `tests/test_split_runs.py` now holds every lane's parts, by its own table, within 1.2 times of each
  other at the count the workflows use, which the one table's deal fails in all three lanes; the parts
  together are still exactly the tests `unittest discover` finds, each once, in every lane and every
  count from one to eight.
- **`--record-durations` writes the lane it ran.** It keeps that table's other files and the other
  lanes' tables, and gives the figure for every lane to a file that had none, so the other lanes deal
  it by a measurement too. `--list --parts 4 --lane advanced` shows a lane's deal.

### Going back from v0.6.12-alpha.2

- **The state, the settings and the advanced edition's file are v0.6.11's.** `state.sqlite` is
  still schema 4 and `config\advanced\advanced.sqlite` still version 2, so going back to
  v0.6.12-alpha or v0.6.11 takes only its setup program or `Install.cmd`, in the edition you have.

## v0.6.12-alpha — The tests in parts, and pictures taken when the window is ready

[The commits in this pre-release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.11...v0.6.12-alpha)

**A pre-release for developers, published from `main`.** It is a GitHub pre-release, so
`releases/latest` never answers with it, and the plugin's own route installs what `main`'s manifest
says, so an installation made that way gets it. An installation of v0.6.11 is offered it by
*Check for updates*, which asks first and says it is tested less. An installation of v0.6.11-beta.2
or v0.6.11-beta.3 is offered v0.6.11 first, because a release is offered before a pre-release, and
this alpha only once it is on v0.6.11; v0.6.11-beta and the copies before it never offer a
pre-release. It is an alpha - not yet for real use - because there is nothing in it to use: it is
upkeep of how this project is tested and how its pictures are made, the first of v0.6.12's
pre-releases, ahead of the version and edition picker and the power action.
**Nothing changes for a person using it.** Both editions do what v0.6.11 does, say and draw what it
says and draws, and make the same calls to Codex. The settings window's new code acts only in a
window the picture generator starts, through variables only the generator sets; a person's window
behaves as before. So unless you are testing the project itself, **Not now** is the answer to the
offer. Going back takes only v0.6.11's setup program ([below](#going-back-from-v0612-alpha)).

**A plugin copy older than v0.6.9-alpha's cannot read this version.** The bootstraps published from
v0.6.0 to v0.6.8 read no word after a version, so none of them can compare `0.6.12-alpha` with
anything, as at every alpha since v0.6.9-alpha; every copy from v0.6.9-alpha's on reads it. Set up
and repair with the installation's own copy, `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume\app\scripts\bootstrap.ps1`,
or with a plugin at v0.6.9-alpha or later.

### The suite in parts

- **One place splits the suite, by measured time.** `scripts/test_parts.py` deals the test files
  into parts balanced by how long each took when it was last measured (`tests/data/durations.json`),
  and runs each part as `unittest discover` runs the suite: the same files, loaded by discover
  itself, in the same order, with a fresh Python for each suite. Every CI lane, the suite the release
  runs before it builds, and the ko sync now run it in four parts, a job each; a lane took 78 to 103
  minutes as one job. `tests/test_split_runs.py` proves that the parts together are exactly the
  tests discover finds, each once.
- **Proven to give a whole run's results.** On the owner's PC each lane was run whole - `unittest
  discover` itself - and in four parts, and the two were compared test by test. Of the tests that
  ran both ways, 4,268 of the standard lane's 4,274 and 4,595 of the advanced lane's 4,596 came out
  the same. All but five of the differences were a probe that ran out of time or a check sensitive
  to timing, under the load of four parts and other work on one PC, and each passes alone, both
  ways. The five were a real leak, now fixed: `tests/test_gui_own_values.py` set the process's
  interface language to English and never gave it back, and `tests/test_locale.py` passed in a whole
  run only because `tests/test_l10n.py` ran between them and reset it. Dealt into different parts,
  five of its tests - 30 checks - failed. The window tests give the language back when they end now,
  and that part, run again, came out as the whole run did in every test.
- **Parts run at once on one PC are not a whole run.** They contend for one desktop and one
  processor, which CI's parts - a runner each - never do. `--compare` names the part each differing

### Faster pictures

- **A window is photographed when it says it may be.** The picture generator photographed each

  sets an event once the page it opened on is drawn from every answer it asked for and holds still -

  `build/capture_window.ps1` waits for that, with the fifteen seconds as its limit. None of these

  another time zone, where it printed the day the pictures were made.

How it was checked: in a scratch copy, against the generator before it, 63 of 67 pictures came out
byte for byte the same, and the other four differed only in History's times of day, which two runs
of the old generator also differ in. A second comparison found seven pictures that differed where
nothing should have, and in each the old generator's window had had the pointer over it - the case
the change above closes.

### Going back from v0.6.12-alpha

- **The state, the settings and the advanced edition's file are v0.6.11's.** `state.sqlite` is
  still schema 4 and `config\advanced\advanced.sqlite` still version 2, so going back to v0.6.11
  takes only its setup program or `Install.cmd`, in the edition you have. Going back further is as
  v0.6.11's entry says ([The state, and going back](CHANGELOG.md#the-state-and-going-back)).

## v0.6.11 — Two editions, and the advanced edition's first capabilities

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.10...v0.6.11)

**What changed since v0.6.10, in one place.** This release went out first in four pre-releases - v0.6.11-alpha
(the ground both editions stand on), v0.6.11-beta (the standard edition's additions), v0.6.11-beta.2 (the advanced
edition's first capabilities, the pre-release offer and the setup programs) and v0.6.11-beta.3 (the page that turns those
capabilities on) - and this entry tells everything they announced, in full, so it is enough to read on its own. It adds
no feature to v0.6.11-beta.3. An installation of any of them is offered this as an ordinary update, being newer.

**From v0.6.10, it is an ordinary update.** It is the latest release, so v0.6.10's *Check for
updates* offers it and installs the standard edition, the only one v0.6.10 knows; the plugin in
Codex installs it too. Settings, a pause, everything waiting and the sign-in choice are kept, and
the watcher's state is upgraded to schema 4 after a copy of it is taken. At its defaults the
standard edition does what v0.6.10 did and makes the same calls to Codex, with two exceptions: a
continuation ends in a shorter marker, and a Windows set to one of the seven new languages gets the
continuation in that language. Every setting it adds is off, or does what v0.6.10 did, until you
change it; what changes with nothing turned on is what is said and drawn, and a few more
content-free questions to Windows, which [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) lists. Going back to v0.6.10
takes one command first (see *The state, and going back*, below).

### Both editions

#### Two editions, and a setup program for each

- **Standard and advanced, released together with one version.** The standard edition is the product
  as it was, plus only what keeps every one of the project's standards; it is what the plugin in
  Codex installs. The advanced edition is the standard one plus capabilities that each depart, on
  purpose, from at least one standard and say which; until you turn one on, it does what the
  standard edition does.
- **The standard edition is what every release so far has been.** The advanced edition is the
  standard one plus one Python package, one skill and some window code of its own; every other
  file in its archive is the standard archive's, byte for byte, apart from the settings window and
  one display name. Which edition a copy is, is decided by whether that package sits beside the
  product's code, and by nothing written anywhere - there is no edition file to get wrong.
- **The standard archive provably holds none of the advanced code.** `build/edition_audit.py`
  checks that no advanced path, file, name or marker is in it - in a text file, a binary or a zip
  inside the zip - that the standard archive rebuilt from `git archive` with `advanced/` deleted is
  byte-identical, and that every standard entry is in the advanced archive unchanged. It runs in CI
  and before anything is published.
- **A release is four files and one proof.** Both archives and their `.sha256` sidecars are
  published together, and one provenance attestation names both. CI tests each edition in lanes of
  its own.
- **A setup program for each edition.** A release now also carries, beside each edition's archive, `CodexAutoResume-Setup-v<version>.exe` and
  `CodexAutoResume-Advanced-Setup-v<version>.exe`: its edition's release archive in one file, byte for
  byte, with the archive's SHA-256 beside it. Double-click it and there is nothing to unzip: it checks
  what it carries, unpacks it into a new folder of its own in the temporary folder, runs that archive's
  own `Install.cmd` in the same console, and removes the folder afterwards - also when its console
  window is closed, and from a temporary folder whose paths run past 260 characters. It takes DLLs from
  System32 alone and stops if a `.config` file is beside it. It is unsigned, as the window's executables
  are, so SmartScreen may ask about it; it is published with a `.sha256` of its own and named in the
  release's one attestation, and [VERIFY.md](VERIFY.md) says how to check it before running it. The
  archives and every other route are unchanged; v0.6.10 had none.
- **An update stays in the edition that is installed.** `bootstrap.ps1 -Update` keeps it and
  refuses `-Edition` (exit 12). Asking for the other edition needs `-Edition` and `-Force`;
  without both it stops with exit 14 before anything is downloaded, and says what changing means. *Check for updates* does the same, and changing edition is a reinstall: run the other edition's setup program or `Install.cmd`.
- **The installer asks before it changes the edition.** It reads the installed edition before it
  touches anything, and goes on only with `-AllowEditionChange` or a yes to `Install.cmd`'s
  question (no is the default). Settings and pending recoveries are kept, every advanced capability
  starts off, and moving back to standard replaces the app folder whole, so no advanced code stays
  behind.
- **Every published bootstrap still updates.** `build/legacy_bootstraps.py` takes each tag's own
  bootstrap, from v0.5.2 on, out of git, and checks with its own code that it accepts the new
  archive.
- **The edition beside the version is now quiet secondary text**: a space after the version with no
  ` · ` before it, smaller (0.62 of the version, never under 10 px), in the standard secondary grey in
  both editions, and on the version's baseline - at the foot of the Dashboard, in the Version row of
  its Diagnostics page and in the heading of the panel in Codex. The notification-area icon's tooltip names the edition after the product, in every language. An advanced installation whose package could not be loaded runs as the standard edition and says so, and `get_status` carries the edition as a code beside the version.
- **[STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md)** lists all 172 of the project's standards by their ids - families 0
  and A to J, which the standard edition keeps, and K, the advanced edition's own rules, which no
  capability may depart from - each with how it is held and the tests that hold it. The code reads its
  ids from it, and a test checks that every test it names exists.
- **[EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md)** says what each edition is, what each advanced capability does, risks
  and departs from, and how to choose, switch, update and verify. The guide, the README and the
  security, privacy, comparison, verification and acceptance pages link both and say what each edition
  does wherever the two differ. They describe the Advanced features page as this release has it (see *The Advanced features page*, below).
- The installer says which edition it installed, and the settings window's file description names
  its edition.

#### Updates and pre-releases

- **Numbered pre-releases.** A version built in stages ships each finished stage as a pre-release, so
  it can have more than one alpha and one beta: `-alpha.2`, `-beta.2` and on, from 2 to 999 with no
  leading zero, the plain word being a stage's first. They sort as they are made - `0.6.11-beta`
  before `0.6.11-beta.2` before `0.6.11` - and every place that reads this product's version applies
  the one rule: the bootstrap, the settings window's build, the release workflow, the check of the
  published bootstraps, the product itself and the community report (`tests/test_version_rule.py`).
- **Alpha or beta.** The word says how far a pre-release can be relied on. An alpha is not yet for real
  use: groundwork, a feature not yet shown to work end to end, or a stored format that may still
  change. A beta works end to end, has passed review and both editions' tests, and stores what the
  release will keep; once a version has had a beta, every later pre-release of it is a `-beta.N`
  ([CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).
- **The update check offers a newer pre-release, and asks.** The owner amended two of the project's
  standards for it: C5, under which the update check asked for the latest release alone and took
  only a plain version, and I12, under which an update never went to a pre-release. *Check for
  updates* now also reads the list of this repository's ten newest releases - one unauthenticated
  request to api.github.com, which carries nothing about your machine. Where there is no release to
  offer first and a published pre-release is newer than both the installed version and the newest
  release, it asks whether to install it, saying which version and that it is tested less than a
  release, with **Not now** as the button Enter presses. Only a yes installs it: in the edition you
  have, after asking the check's questions again and checking it against the `.sha256` published
  beside it, keeping your settings, a pause, everything waiting and the sign-in choice. Nothing else
  installs a pre-release - not the watcher, not the panel, not Codex's tools - and `-Update` still
  installs releases only. From a command line, `-CheckOnly` prints `prerelease: v<version>` on a line
  of its own, and `-Version <version>` installs it.
- **A deadline for the whole request.** Under Windows PowerShell 5.1 a timeout bounds only the wait
  for an answer to begin, so a slow list or compatibility document could keep the check running past
  the window's two minutes. Both are now given up at their deadline.
- **A bootstrap that cannot read an installation's version leaves it alone** until `-Force` says to
  replace it, and its update check answers `update: unavailable`.

#### What waits, and what it says

Nothing here has a setting.

- ***Why it is waiting* says it in words.** Under its list of checks, a sentence says what the
  first check that did not pass is waiting for: the Codex app, the conversation being opened, the
  usage reset, and so on.
- **A recovery's *Timeline* shows what delivery showed.** After its journal it lists, for each
  continuation, when it was seen starting a turn in its conversation, that it was handed to Codex
  and not seen yet, or that its delivery is uncertain - watched for a day and never sent again.
  Only the records' own columns are read for it, never content.
- **Attempts are shown beside the limit they have now:** `3/4`, or `19/6` after the limit was
  lowered - never cut down to the limit.

#### Staying out of the way

Each setting here does what v0.6.10 did until a person changes it: it is off, or it is **Resume
automatically**, **Resume it like the others** or **Every project**. None of them skips a check.
What undoes their holding back is a person's choice - **Don't postpone**, **Let it continue**,
`release_hold`, which Codex asks you about first, and **Let this project resume** - and a task then
goes only when its schedule and every check let it.

- **A task has a menu of its own**, in the Dashboard's Pending page and in the popup, on a right
  click, Shift+F10 or the menu key. **Postpone** holds that one task back 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3
  hours or until 09:00 tomorrow, only ever later - from Codex, `postpone_recovery` takes a number of
  minutes up to a week - and **Don't postpone**, last under it, takes a postponement you made away
  again, back to what the schedule says without it: an objection window's time, a retry's wait and a
  usage reset all stay. Retry now never shortens a postponement, and the Dashboard does not offer it
  while one is ahead. Every item acts on the exact task and its conversation, and is refused if the
  row has since become another task. The menus are drawn in the window's own colours, and nothing
  that was on screen moves.
- **Quiet hours**, under Settings > Advanced - **Quiet hours from**, **Quiet hours until** and
  **Quiet hours on** (every day, Monday to Friday, or Saturday and Sunday) - make a recovery that
  falls due in them wait until they end, on your clock, across midnight and a change of summer
  time. Time spent in them does not count toward giving up on a usage limit.
- **How much a conversation asks first.** **Before resuming a conversation** is **Resume
  automatically** by default. **After a chance to object** raises one more notification when
  everything else would let the continuation go - "Continuing at 14:07 unless you stop it", with
  **Don't resume** and **Open Dashboard** - and sends only once **Time to object (minutes)**, 1 to
  60 and 5 by default, has passed. **Ask me first** and **Only notify me** send nothing until you
  let the task continue, and their notification says the task waits for you - never that it will
  resume. **Let it continue** on the task's row does it, asking you to confirm and sending nothing
  itself, and so does `release_hold` from Codex, which asks you first. The setting applies to
  interruptions detected after it is chosen; **How this conversation resumes**, on a row, chooses
  for that conversation alone, and Ask me first or Only notify me chosen there also holds what it
  has waiting. A task that waits for you has no time: its row says *waiting for you*, and
  nothing says it is being checked.
- **Observe only: check everything, send nothing**, under Automatic recovery, lets the watcher do
  everything but send. Pending and History say when a continuation *would have been sent*, *Why it
  is waiting* says every check but Observe only passed, and the Overview and the popup say observe
  only. It is refused twice over - by the watcher on the setting, and by the claim on a switch of
  the state's own - and a continuation already in Codex's queue when it is turned on is taken back,
  as a Pause takes it.
- **Which conversations and projects resume without you.** **A conversation seen for the first
  time** can be **Only notify me** instead of **Resume it like the others**, and **Projects that may
  resume** can be **Only projects let resume** or **Every project but those held** instead of
  **Every project**; a task's row sets its project with **Let this project resume** or **Hold this
  project for me**. Either only ever holds an interruption for you when it is detected, and a task
  whose project cannot be read is held, never dropped; **Hold this project for me** also holds at
  once what that project already has waiting, and **Let this project resume** lets nothing already
  held go. A project is the one Codex files the conversation under, or else its folder, and the
  settings keep only a 64-digit SHA-256 digest of it - never a name or a path; at the default it is
  not even read. Only a task's row sets the lists: no editor draws them, and MCP refuses them.
- **In Codex**, `postpone_recovery`, not marked destructive since it only holds back, and
  `release_hold`, marked `destructiveHint` since it lets one held task continue, bring the plugin's
  tools to nineteen, and `update_settings` offers the new settings under Advanced, Automatic
  recovery and Notifications. Don't postpone is no tool at all: it brings a send nearer, so only the
  Dashboard and the popup offer it.

#### Guards and waits

The settings are under Settings > Advanced, each off or unused by default, and each can only make a
recovery wait longer, stop sooner or wait for you.

- **Custom retry timing.** **Retry timing** gains **Custom**: five waits picked from lists, for a
  task that fails with a temporary error - the first from 5 seconds to 2 hours, each later one from
  15 minutes to 6 hours, and the fifth for every attempt after it. The 15 minutes are the watcher's
  own floor, not a setting: whatever is chosen, one conversation gets a continuation at most every
  15 minutes and five times in any 24 hours. A rate limit's first wait is still at least a minute,
  and a Retry-After that Codex's structured error names is the least the first wait may be - none
  has been seen yet. **Add up to a fifth to each wait** only ever lengthens a wait. A line under the
  waits, in the Dashboard and in the panel, says what the timing comes to if each continuation fails
  at once.
- **Stop a task that keeps failing after**, 1 to 24 hours, stops a task whose temporary failures
  have gone on longer, less the time it waited for anything but its own retries: time spent paused,
  postponed, in an objection window, in quiet hours or waiting for the app never counts. It stops
  the task as running out of attempts does, **Give attempts back** gives the time back, and usage
  limits are not affected.
- **If the task changed while it waited** - the task-changed guard - compares, just before a
  continuation is sent, the conversation's model and approval mode and its folder's git branch or
  commit with what they were when it stopped. The branch is the folder's `.git/HEAD`, read as a
  file: git is never run, and a network share path is not read. **Hold it for me** keeps a changed
  task waiting for you; **Resume, and tell me** sends it and says so on its notification. Only a
  digest of the three is kept.
- **Tokens a conversation has used** - the context-cost guard - reads Codex's own count when an
  interruption is detected, where Codex's list of conversations keeps one as a number. **Show them
  in Pending** puts it beside the task; **Hold above 100,000** to **Hold above 1,000,000** also keep
  a task whose conversation has used more waiting for you. Where Codex keeps no count, it does
  nothing.
- **High limits are said to be high.** With **Attempts per interruption**, **Stop after this many
  turns without progress** or **Continuations per task** above 8, 5 or 8, a notice under them, in
  the Dashboard and the panel, says a task that keeps failing can then be continued many times, and
  every continuation uses your Codex usage.

#### Sleep, the network and memory

- **Ask me after a sleep longer than**, under Advanced - 30 minutes to 12 hours - holds for you
  every waiting recovery that fell due while the PC slept longer than that. One notification says
  how long it slept and how many tasks wait, with one button, **Open Dashboard**, at Pending, where
  each task's **Let it continue** or **Cancel** decides it.
- **Keep this PC awake while a task waits**, under General > Windows - **On mains power only** or
  **Always** - asks Windows not to let the PC sleep on its own while a task waits, for at most
  **Keep it awake for at most** (6 hours by default) each time tasks start waiting. It is a request
  the watcher makes and takes back - when nothing waits, when the hours are up, on a pause and when
  it stops - and no Windows setting changes: the lid and Sleep still sleep the PC, and nothing wakes
  a sleeping one. While this or **Ask me after a sleep longer than** is on, the watcher also hears
  the PC wake and looks again at once, forgetting what it last read of the app and of your usage.
- **Wait for an internet connection**, under Advanced, asks Windows' Network List Manager - which
  answers from what Windows already knows, sending nothing - whether the PC is online, just before
  usage would be read for a recovery that is due. While Windows reports no connection the recovery
  waits and looks again every minute, and no usage is read; *Why it is waiting* says "No internet
  (Windows reports)". It is off by default because behind some proxies Windows reports no internet
  where there is.
- **The watcher's memory.** After every check the watcher asks Windows how much memory its own
  process has committed, and Diagnostics shows the most as **Peak memory**. That and the record of
  how the watcher stopped, below, are all of this section that happens at the defaults. **When the
  watcher uses too much memory**, under General > Windows, can **Warn me**, once, or **Warn me, then
  stop the watcher**: after the check it is in, never while a continuation is being sent, the way a
  Stop does, with nothing waiting lost and nothing to start it again on its own. The limit is **Too
  much memory is more than**, 256 to 2048 MB, 1024 by default.
- **Stopped, or stopped unexpectedly.** A watcher that is gone without having said so, in the same
  Windows sign-in and the same start of Windows, is shown as *stopped unexpectedly at* the time it
  was last seen - or *stopped by the memory guard at* - in Diagnostics and in the panel, and the
  Overview's Right now says the same without the time. One that ended with an earlier sign-in, or
  before Windows last started, is only not running, as before.

#### Notices and usage

- **When a conversation needs you**, under Settings > General > Notifications, off by default,
  tells you once about a conversation this product will never resume, because only you can move it
  on: a request refused or a conversation too long, a content policy, a sign-in Codex needs, or
  Codex giving up - one check box each - and, with **When a turn has not moved for** set from 10
  minutes to 2 hours, a latest turn still in progress that has recorded nothing new for that long.
  Each has its kind in a word, one next step and one button, **Open Dashboard**, at Settings;
  nothing is resumed, sent or recorded as a recovery for any of them, and a turn you stopped
  yourself is never told. The stall is read from the turn's own columns and when its newest item
  was recorded, never from what an item says, so it never says why. **Play a sound for these**
  gives them Windows' reminder sound; they are then always Windows' own notification, which Do not
  disturb holds back.
- **Codex's usage, as last read.** The Overview's Waiting card, *Why it is waiting* for a usage
  limit, the popup, the panel and `get_status` show the watcher's last usage reading with its age:
  "Codex usage, read 2m ago: 5-hour 100%, resets 14:42 · weekly 62%, ...". Nothing is read for it -
  usage is still read only when a recovery is due - so it can be hours old, and its age says so.
  Only the numbers are kept: which window, how much of it is used, its length and its reset; no
  account, plan or credit. A used-up weekly limit also says the day and time it resets, and that
  `/usage` in Codex can redeem a reset credit if your account has one, which this product never
  knows.
- **A status file for your own tools.** **Write a status file for other tools**, under General >
  Windows, off by default, has the watcher write `status.json` in its settings folder after every
  check: whether it runs, whether recovery is on, how many tasks wait and when the next is looked
  at, and Codex's usage as last read. It holds no conversation, name or path, nothing in this
  product reads it, and it is removed when the setting is turned off.

#### The message sent

- **Message styles stay four.** Minimal, Standard, Detailed, and Custom last. v0.6.11-beta offered a fifth, Careful, which asked what Detailed already asks, so it was folded into Detailed: a stored Careful is Detailed on load and in the migration, the next save writes `detailed`, and a write that names Careful is refused. Every other style's words are byte for byte what they were, in every language.
- **Message for this conversation...**, on a task's row in the Dashboard's Pending page, gives one
  conversation a continuation message of its own, sent instead of the style's whenever that
  conversation is continued, and only for an interruption that is recovered. It is a Custom
  message in every other way - the same placeholders and 2,000 characters, sent exactly as typed,
  with the dialog's own Preview - for at most 50 conversations, and **Remove message** takes it
  away. No model can set it: no MCP tool writes it, `update_settings` refuses it, and the
  diagnostics bundle records only that one is set.

#### Diagnostics

- **Search the log...** opens this product's own log with a search box, newest last, looked at
  again every five seconds while it is open. The log holds reason codes, ids and times - never a
  prompt, a reply or an error's text - and `errors.log` is not read there.
- **State folder**, under Health, says who Windows lets open the folder that holds the settings,
  the pending tasks and the logs: *only your account can open it*, *other accounts on this PC can
  open it* - with a sentence on what that means, and where to install instead - or *not checked*.
  It reads the folder's access list and changes nothing.
- **Show me what happens** plays a recovery with made-up words: a made-up task waits on Pending for
  a minute, then shows in History, and while the watcher runs its icon shows a Demo card whose
  buttons do nothing. None of it touches the recovery state, the card is never a Windows
  notification, and nothing is sent.
- **While tasks wait** says whole what the Overview's line under Waiting says about keeping the PC
  awake and the last usage reading.
- **After an edition change, Codex's copy of the plugin.** When Codex cannot replace its copy of
  the plugin after an installation changed edition, the installer now says which edition that copy
  still is, and that only its skill's text waits for closing the ChatGPT/Codex app and running the
  installer again - the plugin's tools already run what was just installed. Diagnostics says so too
  until the copy is replaced.

#### The window, the panel and accessibility

- **Windows' text size.** The Dashboard, the popup, the notification card and the panel draw their
  text at Windows' **Text size** (Settings > Accessibility), which they read and never change. The
  first three are drawn that much larger as a whole, so nothing is cut, and never larger than the
  screen holds; in the panel the type grows and other lines wrap. At 100% everything is drawn as
  before.
- **Screen readers.** The popup, which draws itself, now tells Narrator and other screen readers its
  counts, each task's row and its switch - "Auto-resume: " and the task - its notes and its two
  buttons, by name, role, state and place, and follows the keyboard; a screen reader's press is
  exactly a click on what was drawn. Every control a person can act on in the Dashboard has a name a
  screen reader says, in every language, and every focus ring stands at least 3:1 off what it
  touches, in every design and theme.
- **Ask Codex**, folded in the panel before Appearance: a few things to type to Codex about this
  product - its status, what it waits for, pausing it, its settings - in the panel's language.
- **One line on the Overview.** Keeping the PC awake and the last usage reading share the one line
  under Waiting, so the card has no line more; it ends in an ellipsis where it does not fit, and its
  whole text is its tooltip and what a screen reader says. No button, header or position that was
  there before moves, and Pending and History stay flat rows.

#### Languages

- **Sixteen languages.** Русский, Italiano, Türkçe, Polski, Українська, Tiếng Việt and Bahasa
  Indonesia join the nine, in the Dashboard, the popup, the notifications, the panel and the
  continuation message. *System* takes Windows' first display language to its own catalog in any
  region - Portuguese from anywhere to Português (Brasil), Chinese by its script - and anything
  else to English. The two language lists name each language in itself only, after *System* or
  *Same as the interface*; about ten rows show and the rest scroll, and typing a letter goes to the
  next language that begins with it.
- **Arabic and Hebrew are translated, and held.** Their catalogs are complete and current, but
  nothing offers them: no list shows them, no Windows language reaches them, and a Windows set to
  either is answered in English. They are written right to left, and they ship only once every
  surface mirrors. The popup, the notification card and the panel already do, held by tests and
  reached by no one while the two are held. The Dashboard does not: WinForms mirrors only a form's
  direct children and none of the painting the window does itself, so every layout and painter of
  it has to be mirrored by hand - a stage of its own.
- **One face per language.** Every letter of every catalog is found in the faces each surface draws
  with. Where Windows' interface font lacks a letter of a language - Vietnamese on a Korean Windows,
  Cyrillic under Microsoft JhengHei UI - that language is set in Segoe UI on all four surfaces,
  rather than one word in two faces; every language the interface font has whole keeps it, and on
  an English Windows nothing changes. The popup and the card are laid out with every string each of
  their places can hold, in every language from 100% to 300%, and nothing is cut.

#### The marker

- **A continuation now ends in `[codex-auto-resume:` and the first 16 of its interruption id's 64
  hex digits**, as the maintainer asked, where it carried the whole id. The rule it serves is
  unchanged: one marker per interruption, and delivery counts only when that marker is found in
  that exact conversation - two of them, or one at or before the failed turn, are still ambiguous.
  A record made before keeps the whole id's marker and is found by it; a record whose short marker
  another record of the same conversation already carries gets the whole one, so no two share a
  marker; and the closing `]` keeps a 16-digit marker from being found inside a 64-digit one. The
  channel is unchanged, `codex queue --thread --message`, and so are the words before the marker.
- **Why no marker at all is advanced-only.** A message queued through Codex's App Server,
  `thread/queue/add`, can carry a client id that Codex keeps with it, and delivery could be proven
  by that instead of a marker. But the standard edition sends through one channel only, the
  `codex queue` command line, which takes no client id; a second channel, and delivery proven
  without the marker, depart from the standard edition's rules. So a continuation without a marker
  can only ever be an advanced capability that a person turns on, with a statement of what it
  departs from. It is the advanced edition's *A continuation with no marker*, below.

#### Custom..., Unlimited and the review before it shipped

- **Custom... at the end of every drop-down of a value**, in the Dashboard and in the panel: quiet
  hours at any minute and on any days, a Custom retry wait within its list's range, **Stop a task that
  keeps failing after**, **When a turn has not moved for** and **Ask me after a sleep longer than**
  from minutes to a week, the memory limit from 128 to 16384 MB, and the context-cost limit from
  10,000 to 10,000,000 tokens - [the guide](GUIDE.md) has the table. In the
  Dashboard a small dialog takes the number and its unit, the hour and the minute, or the seven days,
  and **Use this value** asks the settings' own validator before the drop-down shows it; in the panel
  Save asks the same validator. A value is kept in its shortest exact form, and one past its bounds is
  refused on write and read as the default. The Statistics page's Period is not a setting, so it has no
  Custom... item.
- **Unlimited** for **Keep it awake for at most**: the PC is then kept awake for as long as a task
  waits, and let go, as always, when none does, on a pause and when the watcher stops. Only a limit
  that is yours alone has it: no bound that keeps recovery safe has Unlimited or a value past it, and
  the watcher's own floor, one continuation per conversation every 15 minutes and five in any 24
  hours, is not a setting.
- **Reviewed before it shipped.** The panel's retry preview no longer promises a wait of your own that
  is past its bounds; the panel groups a count's thousands as its language does, as the Dashboard
  does; the German range ends in one full stop, and the Japanese and Korean hint over the seven days
  asks for a day of the week; and a drop-down is measured again when a value of your own is taken, so
  a long list of days is not cut off.

#### Changed in the standard edition

- **The Design called *Soft, without motion* is gone**, since it drew exactly what Soft with Reduce
  motion draws: a stored one opens as Soft with Reduce motion on, the same picture. The Design's description says only what each look is. Soft, Classic (v0.6.2) and Plain remain, and Reduce motion is the one way to stop the motion in each.
- **`-NoStartup` works again.** Since v0.5.2 the bootstrap handed the installer its switches by
  position, so a switch landed on the wrong parameter and the sign-in start was registered anyway.
  The bootstrap passes them by name now, and the installer reads an older bootstrap's switch as
  the one it meant.
- **Nothing the product starts can flash a console window.** Nothing did in v0.6.10 either. Now a
  test covers everything either edition ships, and the ways one could have appeared are closed: the
  sign-in start refuses an interpreter that would open one, the watcher restarts itself only
  windowless, and diagnostics reads the Windows build without starting a program.

#### For administrators

- **Six policy values** under `Software\Policies\CodexAutoResume`, in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` or
  `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`, each of which can only hold recovery back: `DisableAutoResume` pauses it and
  refuses Resume while set; `ForceObserveOnly` turns Observe only on; `DisableUpdateCheck` greys
  **Check for updates...**, which then asks nothing; `DisableStatusFile` keeps the status file off;
  `MaxRecoveryAttempts`, 1 to 20, is a ceiling on attempts per interruption; and `QuietHours`, as
  `22:00-07:00` or `22:00-07:00 weekdays`, adds quiet hours beside a person's own.
  [The guide](GUIDE.md#settings-an-administrator-manages) has the whole table.
- **Read, never written, and applied, never stored.** `startup.py` is still the only code that
  writes the registry. The values are applied after the settings are read, never to the file, so a
  person's own choices apply again once a value goes - except a pause, since resuming is theirs to
  do. Both places' restrictions hold, a malformed value is ignored, one that is there and cannot be
  read holds the most it could, and a change that would loosen one is refused with
  `managed_by_policy`. What a value decides is greyed in the Dashboard's Settings and the panel,
  with *Set by your administrator.*; the Overview says *managed by your administrator* or *paused
  by your administrator*; Diagnostics names the values in force, and the diagnostics bundle holds
  their names, never what they say. Only an installed copy reads them - a source checkout reads
  none - and they are a statement a cooperating installation obeys, not a lock.

#### Around the product

- **Compatibility data 5.** The bundled compatibility data is sequence 5, written by the owner's compatibility tool from that
  machine's own records of real recoveries: codex-cli 0.159.0 is CHECKED in all twelve of its
  capabilities, and codex-cli 0.158.0-alpha.2.1 in two, the engine's presence and exact-thread recovery.
  None is VERIFIED yet. The recordings are under `docs/evidence/compat/`.
- **A compatibility report that passes is filed with no step by the maintainer.**
  `.github/workflows/community-file.yml` wakes when a report's check finishes, and once a day. It
  judges each open report pull request again, against `main` as it is by then, and files this
  project's own regeneration of the report - never the sender's bytes - in one commit that adds
  exactly that report and writes the index, the folder's README and the counts again. The pull
  request is closed, not merged, with one comment saying where the report went, or why it waits,
  or what to do about a refusal. A report used to wait for the maintainer to run their tool.
- **What the maintainer judged is written down as rules**, counted from `main`'s own history and
  keyed by numeric account id: accounts at least 30 days old, one open report per account, at most
  3 filings per account and 5 per Codex version in any 7 days, a budget of Codex versions the
  project's data does not name, half the counts file's room kept free, and a failure on a version
  this project verifies held for the maintainer. A report that meets a limit waits, with the date
  it is looked at again; a younger account's, or a second open one from the same account, is closed
  with when to send it again. The repository variable `COMMUNITY_AUTOFILE` pauses filing on anything
  but unset or `on`, `COMMUNITY_BLOCKED` refuses an account, and a withdrawn report's account and
  Codex version are listed in `docs/evidence/community/withdrawn.json` so that report is not filed
  again.
- **A report comes from a `compat-report/` branch**, as the reporter's `submit` opens it. The check
  refuses one opened by hand from another branch, which the filer would never have answered, and a
  refusal's comment says to close the pull request before sending again, since `submit` sends
  nothing while one of the same account is open.
- **Nothing a stranger sends can reach the write access.** The job that reads their files holds no
  write access and no token while Python runs; the job that writes starts on a fresh runner, runs
  no Python and no repository code, re-derives every commit from git, and moves `main` only
  forward, only from the commit the plan was made on and only onto the tree that was tested - hash
  for hash. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) has the whole list.
- **Two holes the review found are closed for good.** A login Windows keeps for a device (`nul`,
  `con`, `com1`...) is refused as a report's folder: one such file on `main` would have stopped
  every Windows checkout of it. And a Codex version has one spelling: `0.1.0`, `00.1.0` and
  `0.01.0` are one engine to the product, and a report now has to write it the product's way.
- The folder's README is written by `build/community_report.py` from the index, and
  `tests/test_reported_data.py` holds it to that; the maintainer's tool imports that code from
  `main` instead of keeping a copy of its own, which had drifted.
- **The measurements the advanced edition will build on.** Its `measure` was run on the maintainer's
  PC against codex-cli 0.158.0-alpha.2.1, on throwaway conversations only, and its content-free
  records are in `docs/evidence/live/`. A watcher started through WMI outlives Codex's kill-on-close
  job (MW); a message queued while no app holds the conversation is delivered once it is opened
  (M1); a queued `/compact` arrives as plain text, not as a command (M7); and an unattended turn
  whose one approval was declined completed without running the command or opening a window (M6).
  Codex refuses an empty `thread/queue/add` (M3), and a goal set from outside is not taken up by
  the app while it holds the conversation (M2). M4 and M5 lacked what they need on that PC; MA and MH, which needed the maintainer at the app, passed there on 2026-09-28. Two probes that had judged the live machine wrongly were corrected
  first.
- **A link that dev breaks is found on dev.** The Korean documents' sync takes an anchor written
  out as an anchor, and the suite builds the Korean branch's tree from the commit under test, so a
  broken link is found there, not after a release.
- **The pictures are drawn again for what this adds** - Diagnostics among them, from a state folder
  with the access list an installation has, so it shows no warning an installed product would not.

#### Fixed along the way

- **The Korean branch's sync no longer runs out of time.** The suite takes 77 minutes on a runner, so
  v0.6.11-beta's sync hit its 60-minute limit and was reported as cancelled. Its tests now run in four
  parts at once, the publishing job publishes only the tree those parts tested, and a scheduled check,
  `ko-watch`, fails when the Korean branch is still behind `main` six hours after `main` moved.
- **A slow scenario is not a hung one.** The scenario comparisons gave all their scenarios one
  30-minute deadline, which slow runners reached with nothing hung. Each scenario now has a limit of
  its own, half an hour, and a worker that says nothing that long is stopped and its scenario named.
- **The compatibility tests are no longer tied to the published sequence.** They built their document
  at sequence 4, so publishing compatibility data 5 made it a rollback and failed every lane. Their
  document is now the bundled sequence plus one, whatever sequence that is.
- **The standard archive's documents name no advanced identifier.** Two of them spelled names of the
  advanced package that the edition audit refuses in the standard archive; they now say the same in
  words.

#### The state, and going back

- **Schema 4.** The state gains room for what the settings above hold back with - a postponement,
  a word for why a task waits for you, a word for how much a conversation asks, the observe-only
  switch, the needs-you notices, a guard's digest and token count - and for what the watcher says
  about itself: its last usage reading, since when it keeps the PC awake, its peak memory, and how
  it last stopped, with the sign-in and the start of Windows it ran in. At the defaults what the
  settings hold back with is empty, and so is the keep-awake time, since nothing keeps the PC
  awake. The rest of what the watcher says about itself is written at every setting: its peak
  memory and the record of how it stopped, with the sign-in and the start of Windows, at every
  check, and its usage reading whenever usage is read for a recovery that is due. Nothing that decides a send reads the notices. Schema 3 is upgraded
  under the watcher's mutex, after a forensic copy (`state.v3-backup-*.sqlite`), in one
  transaction.
- **Going back takes one command first.** v0.6.11-alpha and v0.6.10 refuse a state this release
  wrote, as one from a newer version, and send nothing. To go back to either, stop the watcher, run
  `downgrade-state --to 3` from this release ([the guide's commands](GUIDE.md#commands)), and only
  then install the older release. It takes a copy (`state.v4-backup-*.sqlite`), keeps every row and
  writes what v0.6.10 reads, never looser than it was: every marker is the whole id's again, a
  continuation that may have gone out with a short marker is made final and never sent again, a
  conversation whose continuation v0.6.10 could not follow to its turn is switched off, Observe only
  becomes a Pause, a hold or a tier other than Resume automatically switches its conversation off,
  and a postponement becomes the schedule. What only schema 4 holds - the notices, the last
  reading, the guards' digests - is left behind. It is proved against the tagged v0.6.10's own
  store and watcher on the simulated Codex; no real older release has been installed over a
  downgraded state yet.
- **Under an older watcher.** While a v0.6.x watcher still owns a schema-3 state, this release can
  still pause recovery, switch a conversation off and cancel its recoveries, written so that the
  older watcher reads every row.
- **The advanced edition's own file**, `config\advanced\advanced.sqlite`, is version 2; the standard edition has none, and a purge removes it. It goes from version 1 to version 2 the first time this version opens one an earlier pre-release made: a column for the warnings a person confirmed is added, and every row keeps what it held. The advanced edition of v0.6.11-alpha and v0.6.11-beta refuses a version-2 file: it reads every capability as off - it has none to turn on - writes nothing to it, and leaves the file for this version or a later one to read again; nothing takes it back to version 1. v0.6.11-beta.2 reads it as it is, so a capability turned on here is still on there, and the hourly limit set here still holds; v0.6.11-beta.2 has no page to turn one on again, only Codex's tools to turn one off, so turn off here first whatever you want off there.
- **Going back to a pre-release of this line.** The state is schema 4 from v0.6.11-beta on, so going back to v0.6.11-beta, beta.2 or beta.3 takes only that release's `Install.cmd`; going back to v0.6.11-alpha or v0.6.10 takes `downgrade-state --to 3` from this release first, as above. v0.6.11-beta reads the settings this version writes: Detailed in place of Careful as Detailed, and a value of your own taken with Custom..., or Unlimited, as that setting's default.

### Advanced edition

#### What the advanced edition stands on

What follows is what every advanced capability goes through.

- **Thirteen places where core asks or tells.** At each, the standard edition asks and tells
  nobody. An advanced capability may always hold something back there; it can never send by itself - the one send is
  still core's, after core's own consent check, claim and pre-send look. A plug is handed copies,
  cannot write core's tables, and a channel it names is held to core's launch guard. The claim
  counts both editions' sends under one lock, so the five-a-day and fifteen-minute limits hold
  across them. Core tells the plug each move of a record as it writes it, so what turns a
  capability off is read from the records, never from the journal, which only a person reads.
- **Its own state, kept apart.** Advanced state lives in `config/advanced/advanced.sqlite`. Nothing
  is added to the product's state or settings files, and a purge removes it.
- **Who turns a capability on, and what turns it off.** Each capability carries a statement, in each of the product's languages, naming the standards it departs from. It is off, watched without acting, or on,
  and only the Dashboard can turn one on. It can be turned off from anywhere, including from inside
  Codex, and "All advanced features off" is one action. A capability turns itself off when a
  submission's result is unknown, a local check fails, the Codex version changes, its statement
  changes or its code fails. Read-only Windows policy keys can forbid the edition, force it to
  watch only, or allow only named capabilities.
- **Measuring before building.** Some capabilities depend on what only a live machine can show.
  `measure <id>` and `measure-verdict` record, content-free, what a person saw on a throwaway
  conversation, in `docs/evidence/live/`.

#### The advanced edition's first three capabilities

Each is off until a person turns it on after reading its statement, which says what it does, what
the standard edition does instead, which standards it departs from, what can go wrong and how to
stop it; and each turns itself off again when what was agreed to stops being true. A pause stops all
of them, and every check a send passes stays the standard edition's. [EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md) has
each one in full.

- **Start with Codex, through WMI.** Codex ends what its plugins start (measured for v0.6.9): its MCP
  servers run in a job that ends with it. On, start-with-Codex starts the watcher whenever Codex
  starts, and where Codex's job would end it, starts it through WMI (`Win32_Process` `Create`, with no
  window), whose own host is its parent, outside the job - so closing Codex does not end it
  (measurement MW). Off, the advanced edition answers exactly as the standard edition does, before a
  single probe.
- **A continuation with no marker.** The words go without the `[codex-auto-resume:` marker, into the
  conversation's queue through Codex's app server (`thread/queue/add`) under a client id derived from
  the interruption, and delivery is proven by that id alone (measurement M7). A send it cannot prove
  is held as uncertain, never sent again, and turns the capability off. Past its ceilings - five a
  conversation, 24 a day - continuations carry the marker, as the standard edition's do.
- **Goal continuation.** For a usage limit whose reset has passed, in a conversation the Codex app
  does not hold, the goal the limit paused is set active again through the app server
  (`thread/goal/set`) - an existing goal only, by its id and status, never its words - so that Codex
  carries it on when the app next opens the conversation. M2 found that the app does not take such a
  goal up while it holds the conversation, and saw the goal live again once the app loaded it; so it
  acts only where the app does not, and looks again just before the set. Nobody has yet followed
  Codex carrying such a goal on by itself. Ceilings: three a conversation, twelve a day.
- **A warning, not a refusal.** A measurement a capability rests on that failed or was never made for
  the Codex in force, a compatibility grade of Failed here, Incompatible or Unknown, or a Codex version
  nobody knows is a warning in its statement, and turning it on confirms exactly those warnings - the
  owner's rule of 2026-09-26, in place of a refusal. Only an administrator's policy still refuses.
  What turns a capability off by itself stays: a new statement, a new Codex version, a failure the
  person did not confirm, or a send it paid for whose delivery became uncertain.
- **The Codex the watcher drives.** The capabilities use the `codex.exe` and the Codex home the
  watcher found and checked, its `codex_exe` setting and `--codex-home` included.
- **What they stand on.** MA and MH, the two measurements that needed the owner at the app, passed on
  codex-cli 0.158.0-alpha.2.1 on 2026-09-28 (`docs/evidence/live/`). The harness gains M2b, which sets
  an existing paused goal active in a throwaway conversation the Desktop has open; until it passes,
  the goal continuation never acts on a conversation the app holds.

#### The Advanced features page

The advanced edition's Dashboard has one more tab, **Advanced features**, after Settings. It is the
one place a capability is turned on; Codex's tools, the panel and the notification-area icon still
only turn capabilities off. [EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md) says what each capability does.

- **What it shows.** Every capability as a row, in a fixed order, with its name and its state - off,
  watched or on - in your language. Choose one and the page shows its statement: what it does, what
  the standard edition does instead, which standards it departs from, what can go wrong and how to
  stop it, every warning it carries now, and its own limits, a day in all and a day in any one
  conversation. Start with Codex sends nothing, and the page says that those limits never come into
  play for it.
- **Turn on and Watch first.** Each asks first in the window's own dialog, with the statement and
  every warning in front of you. Turn on also names the version of Codex it is turned on for, and
  says that a new version turns it off until you turn it on again. A yes confirms those warnings and
  sends exactly what was shown - the statement's revision, the generation the list was read at, the
  warnings and the Codex version - and nothing else. Watch first has the capability asked wherever
  it would act, noting what it would have done, while it does nothing.
- **When something changed while you read.** If the list or the statement moved after it was shown,
  the page reads them again and asks again with what holds now. Where they cannot be read again, or
  keep changing, it says that nothing was turned on; where an administrator's policy now refuses the
  capability, it says that, rather than asking you to confirm what cannot happen. A statement that
  cannot be read says so where it would be, and then the capability cannot be turned on or watched.
- **Why it turned itself off.** A capability that a tripwire turned off says so under its state, and
  why: a measurement or a compatibility check of what it relies on failed, the compatibility data
  says that does not work with this version of Codex, it could not prove that a continuation it sent
  arrived, an error of its own, a new statement to read first, or a new version of Codex. Turning it
  off yourself shows no such line.
- **Your administrator's policy.** Where `ForbidAdvanced`, `AllowedCapabilities` or `ForceShadow`
  applies, the page says so in words, and Turn on and Watch first follow it: nothing can be turned on
  or watched, this capability cannot be, or it can only be watched.
- **Turn off and Turn every advanced feature off** do what they say, at once.
- **The hourly limit.** One limit stands over all the capabilities together, 12 sends an hour. The
  page shows it as a number you can set from 1 to 12 and never past 12; the change is sent with the
  generation the page read, and if something changed while you chose, it is not made and the page
  says so.
- **It follows the watcher.** The page reads the list again after everything you do there, and
  whenever the watcher's status says a capability was turned on or off - here, through Codex's tools
  or by a tripwire.
- **In every language, on every screen.** Its words are in all eighteen languages, kept as the
  window's own are (`build/l10n.py --advanced`). Where the screen is narrower than the seven tabs at
  a large Windows text size, the tabs take a second row instead of cutting the last one off. A
  window that reopens itself on this page - for a theme, a language or Windows' colours - comes back
  to it. An advanced installation whose own part could not be loaded runs as the standard edition and
  shows no such tab.

### How it was checked

- **The ground both editions stand on.** every one of the 283 simulated scenarios gives identical records and identical
  calls to Codex with a plug that defers everywhere, and in the advanced lane with the advanced
  package's own plug. A review from three sides reproduced 21 problems before this was released -
  among them, a plug could change a conversation it was handed and send to one the person had turned
  off - and a second pass found 10 more; each is fixed, with a test that failed before.
- **The standard edition's additions.** every one of the 283 scenarios v0.6.10 was tested with, their test modules
  byte for byte the tag's, runs against the tagged v0.6.10 package and against this one, and every
  `send`, `usage`, `loaded`, `delete_queue` and `app_identity` call is the same, in the same order,
  with the same arguments - the marker aside. The nine older languages' Standard continuation is
  v0.6.10's byte for byte, read from the tag. `tests/golden/defaults-v0.6.10.json` holds every
  default v0.6.10 shipped, written from the tag, and `tests/test_defaults_golden.py` names each
  setting added since, with its default and why that default does what v0.6.10 did, and fails on one
  it does not name. A review after each of the stage's three parts reproduced problems - among them,
  Observe only left a continuation already in Codex's queue to be delivered while the Overview said
  nothing is sent; a postponement of a minute made before an objection window opened took the whole
  window's place; the time ceiling counted time spent waiting, which its help said it never counts; a
  policy value that could not be read was taken for one that was not there, which lifted
  `ForceObserveOnly`; and after `downgrade-state --to 3` v0.6.10 could take the failure of a
  continuation's turn for a new task, and resume one that had been cancelled. Each is fixed, with a
  test that failed before.
- **The advanced edition's first capabilities.** each capability is tested off, watched (asked wherever it would act, doing
  nothing), and turned on end to end against the simulated Codex through the real session and a fake
  app server - its unit spent before it sends, a turn-off that wins at the claim, its ceilings, the
  tripwires that turn it off, turning it on again, a warning confirmed, Codex's tools unable to turn it
  on, and an installation moved to the standard edition and back. A review after the capabilities
  reproduced four problems: they found Codex by a discovery of their own, ignoring the `codex_exe`
  setting and the Codex home the watcher runs with, so with two engines installed every send was "not
  started"; the marker-free continuation did not say that it departs from B3 and B4, as it does; a
  later standard send of the same record going unknown turned off a capability that had paid for an
  earlier one; and the app could open a conversation between the goal continuation's look and its set.
  Each is fixed, with a test that failed before.
- **The Advanced features page.** `advanced/tests/test_advanced_page.py` compiles the advanced window and drives
  the page through the window's own hooks, never shown, against replies this edition's real bridge
  made in a temporary home with a policy, a compatibility view and measurements of the test's own -
  so it reads no real installation, policy or Codex. It holds every row and every field the page
  shows, that what Turn on and Watch first send is exactly what was shown and is what the real bridge
  accepts, the second question after something changed and the two answers that say nothing was
  turned on, every refusal, a capability that turned itself off, the hourly limit, the list read again
  when the watcher says something changed, and a window that reopens itself on the page; it audits the
  page in every language at every scaling, the tabs on the narrowest screen included, and holds that
  the standard window carries no name and no literal of it. A review of the page found that a
  confirmation gone stale could be asked again where it could not be read again or a policy now
  refused it, that a capability that turned itself off did not say why, that the seventh tab could be
  cut off on a 4:3, 5:4 or portrait screen at a large text size, that a window reopening itself
  forgot the page, and that its German, Japanese and Korean words were not consistent; each is fixed,
  with a test.

## v0.6.11-beta.3 — The Advanced features page, where a capability is turned on

[The commits in this pre-release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.11-beta.2...v0.6.11-beta.3)

**A pre-release, published from `main`.** It is a GitHub pre-release, so `releases/latest` never
answers with it, and the plugin's own route installs what `main`'s manifest says, so an installation
made that way gets it. An installation of v0.6.11-beta.2 is offered it by *Check for updates*, which
asks first; v0.6.11-beta and the copies before it never offer a pre-release. It is v0.6.11-beta.2
with the one thing that pre-release lacked: the advanced edition's Dashboard page that turns a
capability on, which the owner asked on 2026-10-02 to follow at once. With it, everything of the
v0.6.11 final is done but the version and edition picker. The standard edition gains nothing here but
the edition's new look beside the version ([below](#the-edition-quiet-beside-the-version)), and does what
v0.6.11-beta.2 did; its window has no such page, and the two points the page needs in the window's
shared code have no body there, so the compiler leaves them out. The watcher's state
and the advanced edition's file are v0.6.11-beta.2's, so going back to it takes only its
`Install.cmd` ([Going back](#going-back-from-v0611-beta3)).

**An older copy of the plugin cannot read this version either.** What v0.6.11-beta.2's entry says
holds here too: every bootstrap published before v0.6.11-beta.2, v0.6.0's to v0.6.11-beta's, reads
no number after `-alpha` or `-beta`, so none of them can compare `0.6.11-beta.3` with anything.
Codex keeps its copy of the plugin until an installer replaces it, which an installer cannot do
while Codex is open. Run from a copy of v0.6.0 to v0.6.11-alpha, a plain setup or repair takes this
installation for none and installs that copy's own, older release over it - and v0.6.11-alpha and
v0.6.10 refuse the state this one keeps and send nothing - while `-CheckOnly` and `-Update` stop with
an error and print no `update:` line. Run from v0.6.11-beta's copy, setup refuses instead, until
`-Force` says to replace what it cannot read, and its update check answers `update: unavailable`.
So with this pre-release installed, set up and repair with the installation's own copy,
`%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume\app\scripts\bootstrap.ps1`, or with a plugin at v0.6.11-beta.2 or
later; if an older copy has already replaced it, run this pre-release's setup program or
`Install.cmd` again. v0.6.11-beta.2's copy and every later one read `-alpha.N` and `-beta.N`.

How it was checked: `advanced/tests/test_advanced_page.py` compiles the advanced window and drives
the page through the window's own hooks, never shown, against replies this edition's real bridge
made in a temporary home with a policy, a compatibility view and measurements of the test's own -
so it reads no real installation, policy or Codex. It holds every row and every field the page
shows, that what Turn on and Watch first send is exactly what was shown and is what the real bridge
accepts, the second question after something changed and the two answers that say nothing was
turned on, every refusal, a capability that turned itself off, the hourly limit, the list read again
when the watcher says something changed, and a window that reopens itself on the page; it audits the
page in every language at every scaling, the tabs on the narrowest screen included, and holds that
the standard window carries no name and no literal of it. A review of the page found that a
confirmation gone stale could be asked again where it could not be read again or a policy now
refused it, that a capability that turned itself off did not say why, that the seventh tab could be
cut off on a 4:3, 5:4 or portrait screen at a large text size, that a window reopening itself
forgot the page, and that its German, Japanese and Korean words were not consistent; each is fixed,
with a test.

### Both editions

### The edition, quiet beside the version

- **The edition beside the version is now quiet secondary text**: a space after the version with no
  ` · ` before it, smaller (0.62 of the version, never under 10 px), in the standard secondary grey in
  both editions, and on the version's baseline - at the foot of the Dashboard, in the Version row of
  its Diagnostics page and in the heading of the panel in Codex. v0.6.11-beta.2 wrote it as more of
  the version's own text, in the same type and size. The notification-area icon's tooltip is
  unchanged.

### Going back from v0.6.11-beta.3

- **The watcher's state and the settings are unchanged.** `state.sqlite` is still schema 4 and the
  settings are v0.6.11-beta.2's, so going back to v0.6.11-beta.2 or v0.6.11-beta takes only that
  release's `Install.cmd`. Going back to v0.6.11-alpha or v0.6.10 still takes `downgrade-state --to 3`
  from this release first, as v0.6.11-beta's entry says.
- **The advanced edition's own file.** `config\advanced\advanced.sqlite` is still version 2, as
  v0.6.11-beta.2 writes it, and that version reads it as it is: a capability turned on here is still
  on there, and the hourly limit set here still holds. v0.6.11-beta.2 has no page to turn one on
  again, only Codex's tools to turn one off, so turn off here first whatever you want off there.
  v0.6.11-alpha's and v0.6.11-beta's advanced edition refuse a version-2 file, as v0.6.11-beta.2's
  entry says.

### Advanced edition

### The Advanced features page

The advanced edition's Dashboard has one more tab, **Advanced features**, after Settings. It is the
one place a capability is turned on; Codex's tools, the panel and the notification-area icon still
only turn capabilities off. [EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md) says what each capability does.

- **What it shows.** Every capability as a row, in a fixed order, with its name and its state - off,
  watched or on - in your language. Choose one and the page shows its statement: what it does, what
  the standard edition does instead, which standards it departs from, what can go wrong and how to
  stop it, every warning it carries now, and its own limits, a day in all and a day in any one
  conversation. Start with Codex sends nothing, and the page says that those limits never come into
  play for it.
- **Turn on and Watch first.** Each asks first in the window's own dialog, with the statement and
  every warning in front of you. Turn on also names the version of Codex it is turned on for, and
  says that a new version turns it off until you turn it on again. A yes confirms those warnings and
  sends exactly what was shown - the statement's revision, the generation the list was read at, the
  warnings and the Codex version - and nothing else. Watch first has the capability asked wherever
  it would act, noting what it would have done, while it does nothing.
- **When something changed while you read.** If the list or the statement moved after it was shown,
  the page reads them again and asks again with what holds now. Where they cannot be read again, or
  keep changing, it says that nothing was turned on; where an administrator's policy now refuses the
  capability, it says that, rather than asking you to confirm what cannot happen. A statement that
  cannot be read says so where it would be, and then the capability cannot be turned on or watched.
- **Warnings, not refusals.** A failed or missing measurement, a compatibility grade of Failed here,
  Incompatible or Unknown, or a version of Codex not known yet is a warning in the statement, and
  turning the capability on confirms it, as in v0.6.11-beta.2.
- **Why it turned itself off.** A capability that a tripwire turned off says so under its state, and
  why: a measurement or a compatibility check of what it relies on failed, the compatibility data
  says that does not work with this version of Codex, it could not prove that a continuation it sent
  arrived, an error of its own, a new statement to read first, or a new version of Codex. Turning it
  off yourself shows no such line.
- **Your administrator's policy.** Where `ForbidAdvanced`, `AllowedCapabilities` or `ForceShadow`
  applies, the page says so in words, and Turn on and Watch first follow it: nothing can be turned on
  or watched, this capability cannot be, or it can only be watched.
- **Turn off and Turn every advanced feature off** do what they say, at once.
- **The hourly limit.** One limit stands over all the capabilities together, 12 sends an hour. The
  page shows it as a number you can set from 1 to 12 and never past 12; the change is sent with the
  generation the page read, and if something changed while you chose, it is not made and the page
  says so.
- **It follows the watcher.** The page reads the list again after everything you do there, and
  whenever the watcher's status says a capability was turned on or off - here, through Codex's tools
  or by a tripwire.
- **In every language, on every screen.** Its words are in all eighteen languages, kept as the
  window's own are (`build/l10n.py --advanced`). Where the screen is narrower than the seven tabs at
  a large Windows text size, the tabs take a second row instead of cutting the last one off. A
  window that reopens itself on this page - for a theme, a language or Windows' colours - comes back
  to it. An advanced installation whose own part could not be loaded runs as the standard edition and
  shows no such tab.

## v0.6.11-beta.2 — The advanced edition's first capabilities, before the page that turns them on

[The commits in this pre-release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.11-beta...v0.6.11-beta.2)

**A pre-release, published from `main`.** It is a GitHub pre-release, so `releases/latest` never
answers with it. It is on `main`, though, and the plugin's own route installs what `main`'s manifest
says, so an installation made that way gets it. v0.6.11-beta and the copies before it never offer
a pre-release in their update check; from this one on, *Check for updates* does, and asks first
([below](#numbered-pre-releases-and-an-update-check-that-offers-them)). It is here because the owner
asked on 2026-10-01 for everything of v0.6.11's final that was finished: the advanced edition's
first three capabilities and the warnings that replace refusals, numbered pre-releases, the
pre-release offer, a setup program per edition, and the interface work. The standard edition at its
defaults still does what v0.6.11-beta did: the advanced edition's code is left out of its archive,
the two new places where core asks are answered by nothing there, and the scenario comparisons with
the tagged v0.6.10 are unchanged. What changes with nothing turned on is what is said and drawn -
the edition beside the version, **Custom...** at the end of every drop-down of a value - and *Check
for updates*, which also reads the list of releases. The watcher's state is v0.6.11-beta's, so going
back to it takes only its `Install.cmd` ([Going back](#going-back-from-this-pre-release)).

**This pre-release does not have the Dashboard's Advanced features page.** That page is the one
place a capability is turned on, and it is still being built; it arrives with the v0.6.11 final.
So in this beta a capability cannot be turned on from the window: the advanced edition carries the
three capabilities, each off, and does what the standard edition does. [EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md),
the guide and the security and privacy pages already describe that page as the final will have it;
until then, read what they say of it as what comes next. Codex's tools list the capabilities and
turn them off, never on.

**An older copy of the plugin cannot read this version, and a published copy cannot be changed.**
Every bootstrap published before this one, v0.6.0's to v0.6.11-beta's, reads no number after
`-alpha` or `-beta`, so none of them can compare `0.6.11-beta.2` with anything. Codex keeps its copy
of the plugin until an installer replaces it, which an installer cannot do while Codex is open. Run
from a copy of v0.6.0 to v0.6.11-alpha, a plain setup or repair takes this installation for none
and installs that copy's own, older release over it - and v0.6.11-alpha and v0.6.10 refuse the state
this one keeps and send nothing - while `-CheckOnly` and `-Update` stop with an error and print no
`update:` line. Run from v0.6.11-beta's copy, setup refuses instead, until `-Force` says to replace
what it cannot read, and its update check answers `update: unavailable`. So with this pre-release
installed, set up and repair with the installation's own copy,
`%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume\app\scripts\bootstrap.ps1`, or with a plugin at this version; if an
older copy has already replaced it, run this pre-release's setup program or `Install.cmd` again. This
copy and every later one read `-alpha.N` and `-beta.N`.

How it was checked: each capability is tested off, watched (asked wherever it would act, doing
nothing), and turned on end to end against the simulated Codex through the real session and a fake
app server - its unit spent before it sends, a turn-off that wins at the claim, its ceilings, the
tripwires that turn it off, turning it on again, a warning confirmed, Codex's tools unable to turn it
on, and an installation moved to the standard edition and back. A review after the capabilities
reproduced four problems: they found Codex by a discovery of their own, ignoring the `codex_exe`
setting and the Codex home the watcher runs with, so with two engines installed every send was "not
started"; the marker-free continuation did not say that it departs from B3 and B4, as it does; a
later standard send of the same record going unknown turned off a capability that had paid for an
earlier one; and the app could open a conversation between the goal continuation's look and its set.
Each is fixed, with a test that failed before.

### Both editions

### Numbered pre-releases, and an update check that offers them

- **Numbered pre-releases.** A version built in stages ships each finished stage as a pre-release, so
  it can have more than one alpha and one beta: `-alpha.2`, `-beta.2` and on, from 2 to 999 with no
  leading zero, the plain word being a stage's first. They sort as they are made - `0.6.11-beta`
  before `0.6.11-beta.2` before `0.6.11` - and every place that reads this product's version applies
  the one rule: the bootstrap, the settings window's build, the release workflow, the check of the
  published bootstraps, the product itself and the community report (`tests/test_version_rule.py`).
- **Alpha or beta.** The word says how far a pre-release can be relied on. An alpha is not yet for real
  use: groundwork, a feature not yet shown to work end to end, or a stored format that may still
  change. A beta works end to end, has passed review and both editions' tests, and stores what the
  release will keep; once a version has had a beta, every later pre-release of it is a `-beta.N`
  ([CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)).
- **The update check offers a newer pre-release, and asks.** The owner amended two of the project's
  standards for it: C5, under which the update check asked for the latest release alone and took
  only a plain version, and I12, under which an update never went to a pre-release. *Check for
  updates* now also reads the list of this repository's ten newest releases - one unauthenticated
  request to api.github.com, which carries nothing about your machine. Where there is no release to
  offer first and a published pre-release is newer than both the installed version and the newest
  release, it asks whether to install it, saying which version and that it is tested less than a
  release, with **Not now** as the button Enter presses. Only a yes installs it: in the edition you
  have, after asking the check's questions again and checking it against the `.sha256` published
  beside it, keeping your settings, a pause, everything waiting and the sign-in choice. Nothing else
  installs a pre-release - not the watcher, not the panel, not Codex's tools - and `-Update` still
  installs releases only. From a command line, `-CheckOnly` prints `prerelease: v<version>` on a line
  of its own, and `-Version <version>` installs it.
- **A deadline for the whole request.** Under Windows PowerShell 5.1 a timeout bounds only the wait
  for an answer to begin, so a slow list or compatibility document could keep the check running past
  the window's two minutes. Both are now given up at their deadline.

### A setup program for each edition

Each release from this one also carries `CodexAutoResume-Setup-v<version>.exe` and
`CodexAutoResume-Advanced-Setup-v<version>.exe`: its edition's release archive in one file, byte for
byte, with the archive's SHA-256 beside it. Double-click it and there is nothing to unzip: it checks
what it carries, unpacks it into a new folder of its own in the temporary folder, runs that archive's
own `Install.cmd` in the same console, and removes the folder afterwards - also when its console
window is closed, and from a temporary folder whose paths run past 260 characters. It takes DLLs from
System32 alone and stops if a `.config` file is beside it. It is unsigned, as the window's executables
are, so SmartScreen may ask about it; it is published with a `.sha256` of its own and named in the
release's one attestation, and [VERIFY.md](VERIFY.md) says how to check it before running it. The
archives and every other route are unchanged; v0.6.11-beta and the releases before it carry no
setup program.

### Custom..., Unlimited, the edition beside the version, and four styles again

- **The edition beside the version.** The Dashboard's save bar and its Diagnostics' Version row read
  `v<version> · Standard` (or `Advanced`), the panel's heading `Codex Auto Resume · v<version> ·
  Standard`, and the notification-area icon's tooltip names the edition after the product, in every
  language. An advanced installation whose package could not be loaded runs as the standard edition
  and says so. `get_status` carries the edition as a code beside the version.
- **Custom... at the end of every drop-down of a value**, in the Dashboard and in the panel: quiet
  hours at any minute and on any days, a Custom retry wait within its list's range, **Stop a task that
  keeps failing after**, **When a turn has not moved for** and **Ask me after a sleep longer than**
  from minutes to a week, the memory limit from 128 to 16384 MB, and the context-cost limit from
  10,000 to 10,000,000 tokens - [the guide](GUIDE.md) has the table. In the
  Dashboard a small dialog takes the number and its unit, the hour and the minute, or the seven days,
  and **Use this value** asks the settings' own validator before the drop-down shows it; in the panel
  Save asks the same validator. A value is kept in its shortest exact form, and one past its bounds is
  refused on write and read as the default. The Statistics page's Period is not a setting, so it has no
  Custom... item.
- **Unlimited** for **Keep it awake for at most**: the PC is then kept awake for as long as a task
  waits, and let go, as always, when none does, on a pause and when the watcher stops. Only a limit
  that is yours alone has it: no bound that keeps recovery safe has Unlimited or a value past it, and
  the watcher's own floor, one continuation per conversation every 15 minutes and five in any 24
  hours, is not a setting.
- **Four message styles again.** v0.6.11-beta's fifth style, Careful, asked what Detailed already
  asks, so it is folded into Detailed: Minimal, Standard, Detailed, and Custom last. A stored Careful
  is Detailed on load and in the migration, the next save writes `detailed`, and a write that names
  Careful is refused. Every other style's words are byte for byte what they were, in every language.
- **Reviewed before it shipped.** The panel's retry preview no longer promises a wait of your own that
  is past its bounds; the panel groups a count's thousands as its language does, as the Dashboard
  does; the German range ends in one full stop, and the Japanese and Korean hint over the seven days
  asks for a day of the week; and a drop-down is measured again when a value of your own is taken, so
  a long list of days is not cut off.

### Compatibility data 5

The bundled compatibility data is sequence 5, written by the owner's compatibility tool from that
machine's own records of real recoveries: codex-cli 0.159.0 is CHECKED in all twelve of its
capabilities, and codex-cli 0.158.0-alpha.2.1 in two, the engine's presence and exact-thread recovery.
None is VERIFIED yet. The recordings are under `docs/evidence/compat/`.

### The standards and the two editions, published

- **[STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md)** lists all 172 of the project's standards by their ids - families 0
  and A to J, which the standard edition keeps, and K, the advanced edition's own rules, which no
  capability may depart from - each with how it is held and the tests that hold it. The code reads its
  ids from it, and a test checks that every test it names exists.
- **[EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md)** says what each edition is, what each advanced capability does, risks
  and departs from, and how to choose, switch, update and verify. The guide, the README and the
  security, privacy, comparison, verification and acceptance pages link both and say what each edition
  does wherever the two differ. They describe the Advanced features page as the final will have it
  (above).

### Going back from this pre-release

- **The watcher's state is unchanged.** `state.sqlite` is still schema 4, as v0.6.11-beta wrote it, so
  going back to v0.6.11-beta takes only that release's `Install.cmd`. Going back to v0.6.11-alpha or
  v0.6.10 still takes `downgrade-state --to 3` from this release first, as v0.6.11-beta's entry says.
- **The settings.** v0.6.11-beta reads what this version writes: Detailed in place of Careful as
  Detailed, and a value of your own taken with Custom..., or Unlimited, as that setting's default.
- **The advanced edition's own file.** `config\advanced\advanced.sqlite`, where one exists, goes from
  version 1 to version 2 the first time this version opens it: a column for the warnings a person
  confirmed is added, and every row keeps what it held. v0.6.11-alpha's and v0.6.11-beta's advanced
  edition refuse a version-2 file: they read every capability as off - they have none to turn on - and
  write nothing to it, and the file is left as it is for this version or a later one to read again.
  Nothing takes it back to version 1. The standard edition has no such file.

### Fixed along the way

- **The Korean branch's sync no longer runs out of time.** The suite takes 77 minutes on a runner, so
  v0.6.11-beta's sync hit its 60-minute limit and was reported as cancelled. Its tests now run in four
  parts at once, the publishing job publishes only the tree those parts tested, and a scheduled check,
  `ko-watch`, fails when the Korean branch is still behind `main` six hours after `main` moved.
- **A slow scenario is not a hung one.** The scenario comparisons gave all their scenarios one
  30-minute deadline, which slow runners reached with nothing hung. Each scenario now has a limit of
  its own, half an hour, and a worker that says nothing that long is stopped and its scenario named.
- **The compatibility tests are no longer tied to the published sequence.** They built their document
  at sequence 4, so publishing compatibility data 5 made it a rollback and failed every lane. Their
  document is now the bundled sequence plus one, whatever sequence that is.
- **The standard archive's documents name no advanced identifier.** Two of them spelled names of the
  advanced package that the edition audit refuses in the standard archive; they now say the same in
  words.

### Advanced edition

### The advanced edition's first three capabilities

Each is off until a person turns it on after reading its statement, which says what it does, what
the standard edition does instead, which standards it departs from, what can go wrong and how to
stop it; and each turns itself off again when what was agreed to stops being true. A pause stops all
of them, and every check a send passes stays the standard edition's. [EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md) has
each one in full.

- **Start with Codex, through WMI.** Codex ends what its plugins start (measured for v0.6.9): its MCP
  servers run in a job that ends with it. On, start-with-Codex starts the watcher whenever Codex
  starts, and where Codex's job would end it, starts it through WMI (`Win32_Process` `Create`, with no
  window), whose own host is its parent, outside the job - so closing Codex does not end it
  (measurement MW). Off, the advanced edition answers exactly as the standard edition does, before a
  single probe.
- **A continuation with no marker.** The words go without the `[codex-auto-resume:` marker, into the
  conversation's queue through Codex's app server (`thread/queue/add`) under a client id derived from
  the interruption, and delivery is proven by that id alone (measurement M7). A send it cannot prove
  is held as uncertain, never sent again, and turns the capability off. Past its ceilings - five a
  conversation, 24 a day - continuations carry the marker, as the standard edition's do.
- **Goal continuation.** For a usage limit whose reset has passed, in a conversation the Codex app
  does not hold, the goal the limit paused is set active again through the app server
  (`thread/goal/set`) - an existing goal only, by its id and status, never its words - so that Codex
  carries it on when the app next opens the conversation. M2 found that the app does not take such a
  goal up while it holds the conversation, and saw the goal live again once the app loaded it; so it
  acts only where the app does not, and looks again just before the set. Nobody has yet followed
  Codex carrying such a goal on by itself. Ceilings: three a conversation, twelve a day.
- **A warning, not a refusal.** A measurement a capability rests on that failed or was never made for
  the Codex in force, a compatibility grade of Failed here, Incompatible or Unknown, or a Codex version
  nobody knows is a warning in its statement, and turning it on confirms exactly those warnings - the
  owner's rule of 2026-09-26, in place of a refusal. Only an administrator's policy still refuses.
  What turns a capability off by itself stays: a new statement, a new Codex version, a failure the
  person did not confirm, or a send it paid for whose delivery became uncertain.
- **The Codex the watcher drives.** The capabilities use the `codex.exe` and the Codex home the
  watcher found and checked, its `codex_exe` setting and `--codex-home` included.
- **What they stand on.** MA and MH, the two measurements that needed the owner at the app, passed on
  codex-cli 0.158.0-alpha.2.1 on 2026-09-28 (`docs/evidence/live/`). The harness gains M2b, which sets
  an existing paused goal active in a throwaway conversation the Desktop has open; until it passes,
  the goal continuation never acts on a conversation the app holds.

## v0.6.11-beta — The standard edition's additions, and v0.6.10's behaviour at its defaults

[The commits in this pre-release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.11-alpha...v0.6.11-beta)

**A pre-release, published from `main`.** It is a GitHub pre-release, so `releases/latest` never
answers with it and an installed copy's update check never offers it. It is on `main`, though, and
the plugin's own route installs what `main`'s manifest says, so an installation made that way gets
it. It is here because the maintainer asked for a pre-release once v0.6.11's second stage was done:
everything this release adds to the standard edition. At its defaults the standard edition behaves
as v0.6.10 did and makes the same calls to Codex, with two exceptions: the marker at the end of a
continuation is shorter, a change asked for on purpose ([The marker](#the-marker)), and a Windows
set to one of the seven new languages gets the continuation message in that language, as it gets
everything else. Every setting it adds is off, or does what v0.6.10 did, until a person changes it.
Beyond that, what changes with nothing turned on is what is said and drawn: the Dashboard, the
popup and the panel say more about what waits, and the product asks Windows a few more
content-free questions - about its own process, about the text size and the fonts it draws with,
and, when Diagnostics opens, about who can open its state folder - which [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md)
lists. The advanced edition still has no capability to switch on. To leave this pre-release for a
later release, run that release's `Install.cmd`; going back to v0.6.11-alpha or v0.6.10 takes one
command first ([The state database](#the-state-database)).

**An older copy of the plugin cannot read this version, and a published copy cannot be changed.**
Every bootstrap published before this one, v0.6.0's to v0.6.11-alpha's, knows no word after a
version but `-alpha`, if that, so none of them can compare `0.6.11-beta` with anything. Codex keeps
its copy of the plugin until an installer replaces it, which an installer cannot do while Codex is
open. Run from such an older copy, a plain setup or repair takes this installation for none and
installs that copy's own, older release over it - and v0.6.11-alpha and v0.6.10 refuse the state
this one wrote and send nothing ([The state database](#the-state-database)). `-CheckOnly` and
`-Update` from such a copy stop with an error and print no `update:` line. So with this pre-release
installed, set up and repair with the installation's own copy,
`%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume\app\scripts\bootstrap.ps1`, or with a plugin at this version; if an
older copy has already replaced it, run this pre-release's `Install.cmd` again. From this version on,
a bootstrap refuses an installation whose version it cannot read until `-Force` says to replace it,
and its update check answers `update: unavailable`.

How it was checked: every one of the 283 scenarios v0.6.10 was tested with, their test modules
byte for byte the tag's, runs against the tagged v0.6.10 package and against this one, and every
`send`, `usage`, `loaded`, `delete_queue` and `app_identity` call is the same, in the same order,
with the same arguments - the marker aside. The nine older languages' Standard continuation is
v0.6.10's byte for byte, read from the tag. `tests/golden/defaults-v0.6.10.json` holds every
default v0.6.10 shipped, written from the tag, and `tests/test_defaults_golden.py` names each
setting added since, with its default and why that default does what v0.6.10 did, and fails on one
it does not name. A review after each of the stage's three parts reproduced problems - among them,
Observe only left a continuation already in Codex's queue to be delivered while the Overview said
nothing is sent; a postponement of a minute made before an objection window opened took the whole
window's place; the time ceiling counted time spent waiting, which its help said it never counts; a
policy value that could not be read was taken for one that was not there, which lifted
`ForceObserveOnly`; and after `downgrade-state --to 3` v0.6.10 could take the failure of a
continuation's turn for a new task, and resume one that had been cancelled. Each is fixed, with a
test that failed before.

### What waits, and what it says

Nothing here has a setting.

- ***Why it is waiting* says it in words.** Under its list of checks, a sentence says what the
  first check that did not pass is waiting for: the Codex app, the conversation being opened, the
  usage reset, and so on.
- **A recovery's *Timeline* shows what delivery showed.** After its journal it lists, for each
  continuation, when it was seen starting a turn in its conversation, that it was handed to Codex
  and not seen yet, or that its delivery is uncertain - watched for a day and never sent again.
  Only the records' own columns are read for it, never content.
- **Attempts are shown beside the limit they have now:** `3/4`, or `19/6` after the limit was
  lowered - never cut down to the limit.

### Staying out of the way

Each setting here does what v0.6.10 did until a person changes it: it is off, or it is **Resume
automatically**, **Resume it like the others** or **Every project**. None of them skips a check.
What undoes their holding back is a person's choice - **Don't postpone**, **Let it continue**,
`release_hold`, which Codex asks you about first, and **Let this project resume** - and a task then
goes only when its schedule and every check let it.

- **A task has a menu of its own**, in the Dashboard's Pending page and in the popup, on a right
  click, Shift+F10 or the menu key. **Postpone** holds that one task back 30 minutes, 1 hour, 3
  hours or until 09:00 tomorrow, only ever later - from Codex, `postpone_recovery` takes a number of
  minutes up to a week - and **Don't postpone**, last under it, takes a postponement you made away
  again, back to what the schedule says without it: an objection window's time, a retry's wait and a
  usage reset all stay. Retry now never shortens a postponement, and the Dashboard does not offer it
  while one is ahead. Every item acts on the exact task and its conversation, and is refused if the
  row has since become another task. The menus are drawn in the window's own colours, and nothing
  that was on screen moves.
- **Quiet hours**, under Settings > Advanced - **Quiet hours from**, **Quiet hours until** and
  **Quiet hours on** (every day, Monday to Friday, or Saturday and Sunday) - make a recovery that
  falls due in them wait until they end, on your clock, across midnight and a change of summer
  time. Time spent in them does not count toward giving up on a usage limit.
- **How much a conversation asks first.** **Before resuming a conversation** is **Resume
  automatically** by default. **After a chance to object** raises one more notification when
  everything else would let the continuation go - "Continuing at 14:07 unless you stop it", with
  **Don't resume** and **Open Dashboard** - and sends only once **Time to object (minutes)**, 1 to
  60 and 5 by default, has passed. **Ask me first** and **Only notify me** send nothing until you
  let the task continue, and their notification says the task waits for you - never that it will
  resume. **Let it continue** on the task's row does it, asking you to confirm and sending nothing
  itself, and so does `release_hold` from Codex, which asks you first. The setting applies to
  interruptions detected after it is chosen; **How this conversation resumes**, on a row, chooses
  for that conversation alone, and Ask me first or Only notify me chosen there also holds what it
  has waiting. A task that waits for you has no time: its row says *waiting for you*, and
  nothing says it is being checked.
- **Observe only: check everything, send nothing**, under Automatic recovery, lets the watcher do
  everything but send. Pending and History say when a continuation *would have been sent*, *Why it
  is waiting* says every check but Observe only passed, and the Overview and the popup say observe
  only. It is refused twice over - by the watcher on the setting, and by the claim on a switch of
  the state's own - and a continuation already in Codex's queue when it is turned on is taken back,
  as a Pause takes it.
- **Which conversations and projects resume without you.** **A conversation seen for the first
  time** can be **Only notify me** instead of **Resume it like the others**, and **Projects that may
  resume** can be **Only projects let resume** or **Every project but those held** instead of
  **Every project**; a task's row sets its project with **Let this project resume** or **Hold this
  project for me**. Either only ever holds an interruption for you when it is detected, and a task
  whose project cannot be read is held, never dropped; **Hold this project for me** also holds at
  once what that project already has waiting, and **Let this project resume** lets nothing already
  held go. A project is the one Codex files the conversation under, or else its folder, and the
  settings keep only a 64-digit SHA-256 digest of it - never a name or a path; at the default it is
  not even read. Only a task's row sets the lists: no editor draws them, and MCP refuses them.
- **In Codex**, `postpone_recovery`, not marked destructive since it only holds back, and
  `release_hold`, marked `destructiveHint` since it lets one held task continue, bring the plugin's
  tools to nineteen, and `update_settings` offers the new settings under Advanced, Automatic
  recovery and Notifications. Don't postpone is no tool at all: it brings a send nearer, so only the
  Dashboard and the popup offer it.

### Guards and waits

The settings are under Settings > Advanced, each off or unused by default, and each can only make a
recovery wait longer, stop sooner or wait for you.

- **Custom retry timing.** **Retry timing** gains **Custom**: five waits picked from lists, for a
  task that fails with a temporary error - the first from 5 seconds to 2 hours, each later one from
  15 minutes to 6 hours, and the fifth for every attempt after it. The 15 minutes are the watcher's
  own floor, not a setting: whatever is chosen, one conversation gets a continuation at most every
  15 minutes and five times in any 24 hours. A rate limit's first wait is still at least a minute,
  and a Retry-After that Codex's structured error names is the least the first wait may be - none
  has been seen yet. **Add up to a fifth to each wait** only ever lengthens a wait. A line under the
  waits, in the Dashboard and in the panel, says what the timing comes to if each continuation fails
  at once.
- **Stop a task that keeps failing after**, 1 to 24 hours, stops a task whose temporary failures
  have gone on longer, less the time it waited for anything but its own retries: time spent paused,
  postponed, in an objection window, in quiet hours or waiting for the app never counts. It stops
  the task as running out of attempts does, **Give attempts back** gives the time back, and usage
  limits are not affected.
- **If the task changed while it waited** - the task-changed guard - compares, just before a
  continuation is sent, the conversation's model and approval mode and its folder's git branch or
  commit with what they were when it stopped. The branch is the folder's `.git/HEAD`, read as a
  file: git is never run, and a network share path is not read. **Hold it for me** keeps a changed
  task waiting for you; **Resume, and tell me** sends it and says so on its notification. Only a
  digest of the three is kept.
- **Tokens a conversation has used** - the context-cost guard - reads Codex's own count when an
  interruption is detected, where Codex's list of conversations keeps one as a number. **Show them
  in Pending** puts it beside the task; **Hold above 100,000** to **Hold above 1,000,000** also keep
  a task whose conversation has used more waiting for you. Where Codex keeps no count, it does
  nothing.
- **High limits are said to be high.** With **Attempts per interruption**, **Stop after this many
  turns without progress** or **Continuations per task** above 8, 5 or 8, a notice under them, in
  the Dashboard and the panel, says a task that keeps failing can then be continued many times, and
  every continuation uses your Codex usage.

### Sleep, the network and memory

- **Ask me after a sleep longer than**, under Advanced - 30 minutes to 12 hours - holds for you
  every waiting recovery that fell due while the PC slept longer than that. One notification says
  how long it slept and how many tasks wait, with one button, **Open Dashboard**, at Pending, where
  each task's **Let it continue** or **Cancel** decides it.
- **Keep this PC awake while a task waits**, under General > Windows - **On mains power only** or
  **Always** - asks Windows not to let the PC sleep on its own while a task waits, for at most
  **Keep it awake for at most** (6 hours by default) each time tasks start waiting. It is a request
  the watcher makes and takes back - when nothing waits, when the hours are up, on a pause and when
  it stops - and no Windows setting changes: the lid and Sleep still sleep the PC, and nothing wakes
  a sleeping one. While this or **Ask me after a sleep longer than** is on, the watcher also hears
  the PC wake and looks again at once, forgetting what it last read of the app and of your usage.
- **Wait for an internet connection**, under Advanced, asks Windows' Network List Manager - which
  answers from what Windows already knows, sending nothing - whether the PC is online, just before
  usage would be read for a recovery that is due. While Windows reports no connection the recovery
  waits and looks again every minute, and no usage is read; *Why it is waiting* says "No internet
  (Windows reports)". It is off by default because behind some proxies Windows reports no internet
  where there is.
- **The watcher's memory.** After every check the watcher asks Windows how much memory its own
  process has committed, and Diagnostics shows the most as **Peak memory**. That and the record of
  how the watcher stopped, below, are all of this section that happens at the defaults. **When the
  watcher uses too much memory**, under General > Windows, can **Warn me**, once, or **Warn me, then
  stop the watcher**: after the check it is in, never while a continuation is being sent, the way a
  Stop does, with nothing waiting lost and nothing to start it again on its own. The limit is **Too
  much memory is more than**, 256 to 2048 MB, 1024 by default.
- **Stopped, or stopped unexpectedly.** A watcher that is gone without having said so, in the same
  Windows sign-in and the same start of Windows, is shown as *stopped unexpectedly at* the time it
  was last seen - or *stopped by the memory guard at* - in Diagnostics and in the panel, and the
  Overview's Right now says the same without the time. One that ended with an earlier sign-in, or
  before Windows last started, is only not running, as before.

### Notices and usage

- **When a conversation needs you**, under Settings > General > Notifications, off by default,
  tells you once about a conversation this product will never resume, because only you can move it
  on: a request refused or a conversation too long, a content policy, a sign-in Codex needs, or
  Codex giving up - one check box each - and, with **When a turn has not moved for** set from 10
  minutes to 2 hours, a latest turn still in progress that has recorded nothing new for that long.
  Each has its kind in a word, one next step and one button, **Open Dashboard**, at Settings;
  nothing is resumed, sent or recorded as a recovery for any of them, and a turn you stopped
  yourself is never told. The stall is read from the turn's own columns and when its newest item
  was recorded, never from what an item says, so it never says why. **Play a sound for these**
  gives them Windows' reminder sound; they are then always Windows' own notification, which Do not
  disturb holds back.
- **Codex's usage, as last read.** The Overview's Waiting card, *Why it is waiting* for a usage
  limit, the popup, the panel and `get_status` show the watcher's last usage reading with its age:
  "Codex usage, read 2m ago: 5-hour 100%, resets 14:42 · weekly 62%, ...". Nothing is read for it -
  usage is still read only when a recovery is due - so it can be hours old, and its age says so.
  Only the numbers are kept: which window, how much of it is used, its length and its reset; no
  account, plan or credit. A used-up weekly limit also says the day and time it resets, and that
  `/usage` in Codex can redeem a reset credit if your account has one, which this product never
  knows.
- **A status file for your own tools.** **Write a status file for other tools**, under General >
  Windows, off by default, has the watcher write `status.json` in its settings folder after every
  check: whether it runs, whether recovery is on, how many tasks wait and when the next is looked
  at, and Codex's usage as last read. It holds no conversation, name or path, nothing in this
  product reads it, and it is removed when the setting is turned off.

### The message sent

- **Careful**, a new **Message style**, is the Standard message and a request to check what has
  already happened and not to repeat any step that already changed files, pushed, sent or published
  something. Standard stays the default.
- **Message for this conversation...**, on a task's row in the Dashboard's Pending page, gives one
  conversation a continuation message of its own, sent instead of the style's whenever that
  conversation is continued, and only for an interruption that is recovered. It is a Custom
  message in every other way - the same placeholders and 2,000 characters, sent exactly as typed,
  with the dialog's own Preview - for at most 50 conversations, and **Remove message** takes it
  away. No model can set it: no MCP tool writes it, `update_settings` refuses it, and the
  diagnostics bundle records only that one is set.

### Diagnostics

- **Search the log...** opens this product's own log with a search box, newest last, looked at
  again every five seconds while it is open. The log holds reason codes, ids and times - never a
  prompt, a reply or an error's text - and `errors.log` is not read there.
- **State folder**, under Health, says who Windows lets open the folder that holds the settings,
  the pending tasks and the logs: *only your account can open it*, *other accounts on this PC can
  open it* - with a sentence on what that means, and where to install instead - or *not checked*.
  It reads the folder's access list and changes nothing.
- **Show me what happens** plays a recovery with made-up words: a made-up task waits on Pending for
  a minute, then shows in History, and while the watcher runs its icon shows a Demo card whose
  buttons do nothing. None of it touches the recovery state, the card is never a Windows
  notification, and nothing is sent.
- **While tasks wait** says whole what the Overview's line under Waiting says about keeping the PC
  awake and the last usage reading.
- **After an edition change, Codex's copy of the plugin.** When Codex cannot replace its copy of
  the plugin after an installation changed edition, the installer now says which edition that copy
  still is, and that only its skill's text waits for closing the ChatGPT/Codex app and running the
  installer again - the plugin's tools already run what was just installed. Diagnostics says so too
  until the copy is replaced.

### The window, the panel and accessibility

- **Windows' text size.** The Dashboard, the popup, the notification card and the panel draw their
  text at Windows' **Text size** (Settings > Accessibility), which they read and never change. The
  first three are drawn that much larger as a whole, so nothing is cut, and never larger than the
  screen holds; in the panel the type grows and other lines wrap. At 100% everything is drawn as
  before.
- **Screen readers.** The popup, which draws itself, now tells Narrator and other screen readers its
  counts, each task's row and its switch - "Auto-resume: " and the task - its notes and its two
  buttons, by name, role, state and place, and follows the keyboard; a screen reader's press is
  exactly a click on what was drawn. Every control a person can act on in the Dashboard has a name a
  screen reader says, in every language, and every focus ring stands at least 3:1 off what it
  touches, in every design and theme.
- **Ask Codex**, folded in the panel before Appearance: a few things to type to Codex about this
  product - its status, what it waits for, pausing it, its settings - in the panel's language.
- **One line on the Overview.** Keeping the PC awake and the last usage reading share the one line
  under Waiting, so the card has no line more; it ends in an ellipsis where it does not fit, and its
  whole text is its tooltip and what a screen reader says. No button, header or position that was
  there before moves, and Pending and History stay flat rows.

### Languages

- **Sixteen languages.** Русский, Italiano, Türkçe, Polski, Українська, Tiếng Việt and Bahasa
  Indonesia join the nine, in the Dashboard, the popup, the notifications, the panel and the
  continuation message. *System* takes Windows' first display language to its own catalog in any
  region - Portuguese from anywhere to Português (Brasil), Chinese by its script - and anything
  else to English. The two language lists name each language in itself only, after *System* or
  *Same as the interface*; about ten rows show and the rest scroll, and typing a letter goes to the
  next language that begins with it.
- **Arabic and Hebrew are translated, and held.** Their catalogs are complete and current, but
  nothing offers them: no list shows them, no Windows language reaches them, and a Windows set to
  either is answered in English. They are written right to left, and they ship only once every
  surface mirrors. The popup, the notification card and the panel already do, held by tests and
  reached by no one while the two are held. The Dashboard does not: WinForms mirrors only a form's
  direct children and none of the painting the window does itself, so every layout and painter of
  it has to be mirrored by hand - a stage of its own.
- **One face per language.** Every letter of every catalog is found in the faces each surface draws
  with. Where Windows' interface font lacks a letter of a language - Vietnamese on a Korean Windows,
  Cyrillic under Microsoft JhengHei UI - that language is set in Segoe UI on all four surfaces,
  rather than one word in two faces; every language the interface font has whole keeps it, and on
  an English Windows nothing changes. The popup and the card are laid out with every string each of
  their places can hold, in every language from 100% to 300%, and nothing is cut.

### The state database

- **Schema 4.** The state gains room for what the settings above hold back with - a postponement,
  a word for why a task waits for you, a word for how much a conversation asks, the observe-only
  switch, the needs-you notices, a guard's digest and token count - and for what the watcher says
  about itself: its last usage reading, since when it keeps the PC awake, its peak memory, and how
  it last stopped, with the sign-in and the start of Windows it ran in. At the defaults what the
  settings hold back with is empty, and so is the keep-awake time, since nothing keeps the PC
  awake. The rest of what the watcher says about itself is written at every setting: its peak
  memory and the record of how it stopped, with the sign-in and the start of Windows, at every
  check, and its usage reading whenever usage is read for a recovery that is due. Nothing that decides a send reads the notices. Schema 3 is upgraded
  under the watcher's mutex, after a forensic copy (`state.v3-backup-*.sqlite`), in one
  transaction.
- **Going back takes one command first.** v0.6.11-alpha and v0.6.10 refuse a state this release
  wrote, as one from a newer version, and send nothing. To go back to either, stop the watcher, run
  `downgrade-state --to 3` from this release ([the guide's commands](GUIDE.md#commands)), and only
  then install the older release. It takes a copy (`state.v4-backup-*.sqlite`), keeps every row and
  writes what v0.6.10 reads, never looser than it was: every marker is the whole id's again, a
  continuation that may have gone out with a short marker is made final and never sent again, a
  conversation whose continuation v0.6.10 could not follow to its turn is switched off, Observe only
  becomes a Pause, a hold or a tier other than Resume automatically switches its conversation off,
  and a postponement becomes the schedule. What only schema 4 holds - the notices, the last
  reading, the guards' digests - is left behind. It is proved against the tagged v0.6.10's own
  store and watcher on the simulated Codex; no real older release has been installed over a
  downgraded state yet.
- **Under an older watcher.** While a v0.6.x watcher still owns a schema-3 state, this release can
  still pause recovery, switch a conversation off and cancel its recoveries, written so that the
  older watcher reads every row.

### For administrators

- **Six policy values** under `Software\Policies\CodexAutoResume`, in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` or
  `HKEY_CURRENT_USER`, each of which can only hold recovery back: `DisableAutoResume` pauses it and
  refuses Resume while set; `ForceObserveOnly` turns Observe only on; `DisableUpdateCheck` greys
  **Check for updates...**, which then asks nothing; `DisableStatusFile` keeps the status file off;
  `MaxRecoveryAttempts`, 1 to 20, is a ceiling on attempts per interruption; and `QuietHours`, as
  `22:00-07:00` or `22:00-07:00 weekdays`, adds quiet hours beside a person's own.
  [The guide](GUIDE.md#settings-an-administrator-manages) has the whole table.
- **Read, never written, and applied, never stored.** `startup.py` is still the only code that
  writes the registry. The values are applied after the settings are read, never to the file, so a
  person's own choices apply again once a value goes - except a pause, since resuming is theirs to
  do. Both places' restrictions hold, a malformed value is ignored, one that is there and cannot be
  read holds the most it could, and a change that would loosen one is refused with
  `managed_by_policy`. What a value decides is greyed in the Dashboard's Settings and the panel,
  with *Set by your administrator.*; the Overview says *managed by your administrator* or *paused
  by your administrator*; Diagnostics names the values in force, and the diagnostics bundle holds
  their names, never what they say. Only an installed copy reads them - a source checkout reads
  none - and they are a statement a cooperating installation obeys, not a lock.

### The marker

- **A continuation now ends in `[codex-auto-resume:` and the first 16 of its interruption id's 64
  hex digits**, as the maintainer asked, where it carried the whole id. The rule it serves is
  unchanged: one marker per interruption, and delivery counts only when that marker is found in
  that exact conversation - two of them, or one at or before the failed turn, are still ambiguous.
  A record made before keeps the whole id's marker and is found by it; a record whose short marker
  another record of the same conversation already carries gets the whole one, so no two share a
  marker; and the closing `]` keeps a 16-digit marker from being found inside a 64-digit one. The
  channel is unchanged, `codex queue --thread --message`, and so are the words before the marker.
- **Why no marker at all is advanced-only.** A message queued through Codex's App Server,
  `thread/queue/add`, can carry a client id that Codex keeps with it, and delivery could be proven
  by that instead of a marker. But the standard edition sends through one channel only, the
  `codex queue` command line, which takes no client id; a second channel, and delivery proven
  without the marker, depart from the standard edition's rules. So a continuation without a marker
  can only ever be an advanced capability that a person turns on, with a statement of what it
  departs from. Nothing of it is in this pre-release.

### Around the product

- **The measurements the advanced edition will build on.** Its `measure` was run on the maintainer's
  PC against codex-cli 0.158.0-alpha.2.1, on throwaway conversations only, and its content-free
  records are in `docs/evidence/live/`. A watcher started through WMI outlives Codex's kill-on-close
  job (MW); a message queued while no app holds the conversation is delivered once it is opened
  (M1); a queued `/compact` arrives as plain text, not as a command (M7); and an unattended turn
  whose one approval was declined completed without running the command or opening a window (M6).
  Codex refuses an empty `thread/queue/add` (M3), and a goal set from outside is not taken up by
  the app while it holds the conversation (M2). M4 and M5 lacked what they need on that PC; MH
  waits for the maintainer to point the Desktop at a second `CODEX_HOME`, and MA for the maintainer
  to sign out and back in. Two probes that had judged the live machine wrongly were corrected
  first.
- **A link that dev breaks is found on dev.** The Korean documents' sync takes an anchor written
  out as an anchor, and the suite builds the Korean branch's tree from the commit under test, so a
  broken link is found there, not after a release.
- **The pictures are drawn again for what this adds** - Diagnostics among them, from a state folder
  with the access list an installation has, so it shows no warning an installed product would not.

## v0.6.11-alpha — Two editions, and the ground the advanced one stands on

[The commits in this pre-release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.10...v0.6.11-alpha)

**A pre-release, published from `main`.** It is a GitHub pre-release, so `releases/latest` never
answers with it and an installed copy's update check never offers it. It is on `main`, though, and
the plugin's own route installs what `main`'s manifest says, so an installation made that way gets
it. It is here because v0.6.11 adds features in two editions and has to be built in stages, and
this one - the ground both editions stand on - is not a release on its own: there is no advanced
feature in it to switch on yet. The standard edition behaves as v0.6.10 did, apart from what
[In the standard edition](#in-the-standard-edition) lists. To leave it, run `Install.cmd` from any
later release's archive.

### Both editions

### Two editions, from one repository

- **The standard edition is what every release so far has been.** The advanced edition is the
  standard one plus one Python package, one skill and some window code of its own; every other
  file in its archive is the standard archive's, byte for byte, apart from the settings window and
  one display name. Which edition a copy is, is decided by whether that package sits beside the
  product's code, and by nothing written anywhere - there is no edition file to get wrong.
- **The standard archive provably holds none of the advanced code.** `build/edition_audit.py`
  checks that no advanced path, file, name or marker is in it - in a text file, a binary or a zip
  inside the zip - that the standard archive rebuilt from `git archive` with `advanced/` deleted is
  byte-identical, and that every standard entry is in the advanced archive unchanged. It runs in CI
  and before anything is published.
- **A release is four files and one proof.** Both archives and their `.sha256` sidecars are
  published together, and one provenance attestation names both. CI tests each edition in lanes of
  its own.

### Staying in an edition

- **An update stays in the edition that is installed.** `bootstrap.ps1 -Update` keeps it and
  refuses `-Edition` (exit 12). Asking for the other edition needs `-Edition` and `-Force`;
  without both it stops with exit 14 before anything is downloaded, and says what changing means.
- **The installer asks before it changes the edition.** It reads the installed edition before it
  touches anything, and goes on only with `-AllowEditionChange` or a yes to `Install.cmd`'s
  question (no is the default). Settings and pending recoveries are kept, every advanced capability
  starts off, and moving back to standard replaces the app folder whole, so no advanced code stays
  behind.
- **Every published bootstrap still updates.** `build/legacy_bootstraps.py` takes each tag's own
  bootstrap, from v0.5.2 on, out of git, and checks with its own code that it accepts the new
  archive.

### In the standard edition

- **The Design called Still is gone; Reduce motion does what it did.** It drew exactly what Soft
  with Reduce motion draws, so there were two ways to one picture. A stored Still opens as Soft with
  Reduce motion on, the same picture from the window's first frame. Reduce motion is the one way to
  stop the motion now, in every design. And the Design's description says only what each look is.
- **`-NoStartup` works again.** Since v0.5.2 the bootstrap handed the installer its switches by
  position, so a switch landed on the wrong parameter and the sign-in start was registered anyway.
  The bootstrap passes them by name now, and the installer reads an older bootstrap's switch as
  the one it meant.
- **Nothing the product starts can flash a console window.** Nothing did in v0.6.10 either. Now a
  test covers everything either edition ships, and the ways one could have appeared are closed: the
  sign-in start refuses an interpreter that would open one, the watcher restarts itself only
  windowless, and diagnostics reads the Windows build without starting a program.
- The installer says which edition it installed, and the settings window's file description names
  its edition.

### Around the product

- **A compatibility report that passes is filed with no step by the maintainer.**
  `.github/workflows/community-file.yml` wakes when a report's check finishes, and once a day. It
  judges each open report pull request again, against `main` as it is by then, and files this
  project's own regeneration of the report - never the sender's bytes - in one commit that adds
  exactly that report and writes the index, the folder's README and the counts again. The pull
  request is closed, not merged, with one comment saying where the report went, or why it waits,
  or what to do about a refusal. A report used to wait for the maintainer to run their tool.
- **What the maintainer judged is written down as rules**, counted from `main`'s own history and
  keyed by numeric account id: accounts at least 30 days old, one open report per account, at most
  3 filings per account and 5 per Codex version in any 7 days, a budget of Codex versions the
  project's data does not name, half the counts file's room kept free, and a failure on a version
  this project verifies held for the maintainer. A report that meets a limit waits, with the date
  it is looked at again; a younger account's, or a second open one from the same account, is closed
  with when to send it again. The repository variable `COMMUNITY_AUTOFILE` pauses filing on anything
  but unset or `on`, `COMMUNITY_BLOCKED` refuses an account, and a withdrawn report's account and
  Codex version are listed in `docs/evidence/community/withdrawn.json` so that report is not filed
  again.
- **A report comes from a `compat-report/` branch**, as the reporter's `submit` opens it. The check
  refuses one opened by hand from another branch, which the filer would never have answered, and a
  refusal's comment says to close the pull request before sending again, since `submit` sends
  nothing while one of the same account is open.
- **Nothing a stranger sends can reach the write access.** The job that reads their files holds no
  write access and no token while Python runs; the job that writes starts on a fresh runner, runs
  no Python and no repository code, re-derives every commit from git, and moves `main` only
  forward, only from the commit the plan was made on and only onto the tree that was tested - hash
  for hash. [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) has the whole list.
- **Two holes the review found are closed for good.** A login Windows keeps for a device (`nul`,
  `con`, `com1`...) is refused as a report's folder: one such file on `main` would have stopped
  every Windows checkout of it. And a Codex version has one spelling: `0.1.0`, `00.1.0` and
  `0.01.0` are one engine to the product, and a report now has to write it the product's way.
- The folder's README is written by `build/community_report.py` from the index, and
  `tests/test_reported_data.py` holds it to that; the maintainer's tool imports that code from
  `main` instead of keeping a copy of its own, which had drifted.

### Advanced edition

### What the advanced edition stands on

Nothing here can be switched on yet: the list of advanced capabilities is empty. What is here is
what every one of them will go through.

- **Thirteen places where core asks or tells.** At each, the standard edition asks and tells
  nobody. An advanced capability may always hold something back there; it can never send by itself - the one send is
  still core's, after core's own consent check, claim and pre-send look. A plug is handed copies,
  cannot write core's tables, and a channel it names is held to core's launch guard. The claim
  counts both editions' sends under one lock, so the five-a-day and fifteen-minute limits hold
  across them. Core tells the plug each move of a record as it writes it, so what turns a
  capability off is read from the records, never from the journal, which only a person reads.
- **Its own state, kept apart.** Advanced state lives in `config/advanced/advanced.sqlite`. Nothing
  is added to the product's state or settings files, and a purge removes it.
- **Who turns a capability on, and what turns it off.** Each capability will carry a statement, in
  nine languages, naming the standards it departs from. It is off, watched without acting, or on,
  and only the Dashboard can turn one on. It can be turned off from anywhere, including from inside
  Codex, and "All advanced features off" is one action. A capability turns itself off when a
  submission's result is unknown, a local check fails, the Codex version changes, its statement
  changes or its code fails. Read-only Windows policy keys can forbid the edition, force it to
  watch only, or allow only named capabilities.
- **Measuring before building.** Some capabilities depend on what only a live machine can show.
  `measure <id>` and `measure-verdict` record, content-free, what a person saw on a throwaway
  conversation, in `docs/evidence/live/`.

How it was checked: every one of the 283 simulated scenarios gives identical records and identical
calls to Codex with a plug that defers everywhere, and in the advanced lane with the advanced
package's own plug. A review from three sides reproduced 21 problems before this was released -
among them, a plug could change a conversation it was handed and send to one the person had turned
off - and a second pass found 10 more; each is fixed, with a test that failed before.

## v0.6.10 — The design settled, and what others report

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.10-alpha...v0.6.10)

### The repository's front page, in one language

- `main` - the front page, the plugin's install route, where releases are tagged - is English only.
  `dev` keeps every document in English and Korean, written and reviewed together, and a
  promotion (`scripts/promote.py`) brings dev to main without the Korean files; the generated `ko`
  branch is built from main's code and the Korean sources of the dev commit it came from.
- The front page lists sixteen entries: `CHANGELOG`, `PRIVACY` and `CONTRIBUTORS` are in `docs/`,
  the installer's source in `build/install/`, and the MCP declaration's in `build/plugin-mcp.json`.
  In the release archive the installer and the MCP declaration stand where they stood, so no
  published bootstrap sees a difference. The archive carries `CHANGELOG`, `PRIVACY` and
  `CONTRIBUTORS` in `docs/`, where its README links them, and, built on English-only `main`, no
  longer the Korean `README`, `SECURITY` and `CONTRIBUTORS`.
- A section-by-section review of all sixteen document pairs found 62 places where the English and
  the Korean said different things; each is fixed in the language that was wrong, and the Korean
  guide now has every section the English one has.
- `CONTRIBUTING`, `SECURITY` and `SUPPORT` moved to `docs/`, in both languages. GitHub reads all three from there, so its security policy tab and the contributing link on a new issue are unchanged.

### The design settled

The look was audited as one product, with the Codex panel as the reference, from light and dark
contact sheets of all four surfaces side by side. What people know stays. Each header keeps its
composition, its words and its places: the popup is titled *Codex Auto Resume* over its state, written
in the state's colour; the Dashboard's light spans its headline and the line under it; and every light
stands where it stood beside its words. The popup's and the card's buttons and chips stay bold, and the
Pending page's check results still read *OK*, *Waiting*, *Blocked* and *Unknown*. What changed:

- **One rule for a header's light.** The Dashboard, the popup and the panel light the same moment the
  same way, and the popup and the panel say the same word beside it, by one rule written down as 40
  test vectors that each surface's own code is run against. A watcher that is not running, or not
  known to be, is a grey light that does not move - the popup used to breathe amber for a stopped
  watcher - and a record held for a watcher that has stopped counts as one; a watcher that runs but is
  not well is amber and breathing. The notification-area icon and the taskbar button keep their own
  rule, in which a failure nobody has seen yet is red.
- **Never "recovery is on" for a watcher that is not well.** Where the watcher runs but has stopped
  responding, an older watcher still owns the state, or the Codex version is not supported or failed
  its checks here, the Dashboard's line under its headline and the panel's facts name that cause -
  *Watcher not responding* is new - where they said *Automatic recovery is on*. The Dashboard keeps its
  own words around it: *Watching for interruptions* over *… · 2 recoveries pending*.
- **A state nobody confirmed is not called fine.** The popup read a status it could not read, or one
  that did not say the watcher runs, as *Monitoring* or *Waiting*; it says *Needs your attention*
  now, beside the grey light. The panel asks for attention, ranked above a pause, for a watcher that
  runs but is not well, where it said *Monitoring*, *Waiting*, *Recovering* or *Paused*, and both it
  and the popup do for an older watcher still owning the state. Where the status did not say whether
  recovery is on, the popup took it as on; it says *Paused* now, and its button offers to resume. And
  it says *Recovering* when the status counts records in Codex, not only when its list shows one.
- **Every light that says the product is running moves.** The panel's Automatic recovery tile carries
  the state's light at a smaller size, where a dot that never moved used to be, and it breathes with the
  one above it, on one cycle that a redraw no longer sends back to the top. The panel's light dims
  toward the ground it stands on, so its glow is no longer a fifth weaker than the Dashboard's halfway
  down a breath. While the panel is open, a clock of its own turns it to *Checking*, with its turning
  arc, when a waiting task's time comes, and that task's row to *due now*; since the panel reads its
  records once and never sees the watcher's next pass, it says so for one pass and then *Waiting*
  again.
- **One button size, one chip size, one callout.** Buttons are 34 px high on every surface, where the
  popup's and the card's were 32 px, and chips have one height and one padding; the popup's and the
  card's keep their bold words. The Diagnostics page's compatibility notices are the panel's callouts,
  where they were a block of accent-coloured text.
- **One name for the window.** The window is the Dashboard wherever it is named - the icon's menu
  says *Open Dashboard*, as the popup and the card do - the popup's switch is *Auto-resume*, as the
  Pending page's column is, and its rows count down to the *Next check*, in all nine languages. The
  Settings help that the panel shows as well says *the Dashboard* where it said *this window* and
  *here*, which in the panel meant the panel, and Reduce motion's help names everything it stops, the
  panel in Codex included.
- **The card's light costs less.** It is drawn as the popup draws its own, only the band of rows it
  stands in, at about twice the frames for between a quarter and a third of the processor time.
  Hovering over it no longer sends its breath back to the top, and it rises in, comes back from a fade
  and slides on the popup's own easing curve.

### Four designs

- **Design**, under Settings > Appearance in the Dashboard, draws the Dashboard, the popup, the
  notification card and the panel in Codex one of four ways, each in light or dark as the Theme says:
  *Soft*, the default and everything above; *Soft, without motion*, the same look held still - what
  Reduce motion draws, chosen as a look; *Classic (v0.6.2)*, v0.6.2's flat cards with a hairline and a
  3 px accent bar down their left edge, its colours read from that release's tag, the current tab
  underlined, and the light breathing with its glow; and *Plain*, flat and neutral grey with the
  product's accent, whose light dims with no glow. Classic and Plain move as Soft does - switches
  glide and the notification card rises in; only *Soft, without motion* takes motion away. [BRAND.md](BRAND.md#four-designs) sets them out and
  the [guide](GUIDE.md) shows the popup in each.
- **A design changes paint, never layout.** Sizes, paddings, the light and the room kept for shadows
  are the same in all four, and corners are only ever smaller than Soft's; the Dashboard's layout
  audit finds every control where Soft's is in every design. The Pending and History lists stay flat
  rows in each.
- **No design can loosen a stopper.** High Contrast replaces every design, and Reduce motion, Windows'
  animation setting and every other reason something holds still hold it in every design: a design
  can take motion away, never add it. The notification-area icon holds still within a second of
  *Soft, without motion* being saved, as it does for Reduce motion, and the panel now follows the
  product's own Reduce motion as well as Codex's reduced-motion preference.
- **Set in the Dashboard only.** Like Reduce motion, the Design decides what moves, so Codex cannot
  change it: `update_settings` neither offers nor accepts it, and the panel draws in it and never sends
  it. `restore_default_settings` puts it back to Soft. An upgrade changes nothing anyone can see: a
  settings file without it reads as Soft. It is in all nine languages; in German it is *Stil*, since
  *Design* is German's word for the Theme.
- **On the wire.** Every reply that carries the settings carries `design`, and the wire goldens were
  regenerated on purpose for it. The tool list did not change.
- **Kept in step from one table.** What a design draws in the Dashboard - its colours and check box
  in each theme, its depth, glow, motion and corners - is generated from the same design table and
  colours the panel and the popup read (`Brand.LookOf` in `gui/Brand.cs`), where the Dashboard's own
  code chose them in ten branches by the design's name; a test now fails if any of its own code names
  a design. It draws exactly what it drew.

### The pictures

- **One set of records, one moment.** The panel, the popup, the card and the Dashboard are pictured
  from one set of records at one set of offsets, so a countdown, a chip and a count say the same on
  all four; until now the panel's rows both said *due now* and the popup had a row the others did not.
- **The same window, the same picture.** The Dashboard is photographed with Windows' keyboard cues
  hidden, as it looks to a person using the mouse. A new window takes the focus ring's state from how
  the last input reached the machine, so the Settings picture had a ring round the Overview tab in some
  releases and none in others, with nothing in the source changed.
- **Every light that moves, moving.** A picture's status lights move as the product moves them: the
  popup and the card frame by frame by their own renderers, and the panel's two lights and the
  Dashboard's drawn over the capture, each on the ground it stands on, for exactly one cycle - a
  4.4-second breath takes 4.4 seconds, where it took 4.356. Until now one light a picture moved, and
  in the panel's pictures not the one that moves in the product.
- **Each design, pictured.** The Dashboard's Overview, the panel, the popup and the card in Soft,
  without motion, Classic and Plain, in English and the light theme, beside Soft's own pictures.
- **Before and after, light and dark.** `build/make_screenshots.py --audit` draws, for developers,
  light and dark contact sheets of the four surfaces, and a before-and-after sheet of each, without
  touching anything published.

### What others report

- **Reported, beside the version.** The Dashboard's Diagnostics page says, in one muted line
  directly under *Codex version*, what other people report about that exact version: *Reported by
  others: worked 3 · failed 1 · neither 1*, with *counted in both* when a report saw both and *none
  yet* when nobody has filed one. It is a grade of its own beside Verified, Checked, Compatible and
  Failed here, and never one of them: no chip, never the success or danger colour, and a version
  whose own evidence says nothing stays Compatible however many reports say it works. `doctor` and
  `compat` print the same counts. The Codex panel points to the row, because the summary a model
  reads stays codes only, and the popup, the notification card and the icon never show it.
- **Counts of reports, not machines.** One report per GitHub login per Codex version. A report
  counts as worked when a record it delivered ended recovered, as failed when one ended in a failed
  recovery, as neither when none ended either way - a report that delivered nothing included - and
  in both columns when its records say both, so worked + failed - both + neither = reports. Only
  filed reports count.
- **Shipped with the release, never fetched, and deciding nothing.** The counts are
  `src/codex_auto_resume/data/reported.json`, a file of their own beside the compatibility data and
  never inside it, read by a hardened reader of their own. No request fetches it: the refresh a
  person asks for still fetches the compatibility data alone, so a report filed later waits for the
  next release. Only the view a person reads imports it, and a test grid holds that no counts - a
  thousand reports that worked, a thousand that failed, a broken file - move any state, permit or
  anything the watcher writes. No compatibility claim may cite someone else's report.
- **A report arrives as a pull request, and is read as data.** `build/community_report.py` is the
  one reader of a report: capped, exact about its keys, its times and its fingerprint - the setup
  that measured it - and recomputing the levels and verdict it claims, which can only go down.
  `.github/workflows/community-report.yml` judges a report's pull request with `main`'s own check,
  under a read-only token, reading the head with git plumbing only: one new file at
  `docs/evidence/community/<login>/codex-cli-<version>.json`, add-only, at most 1 MB, and not a
  copy of a filed report. Tests hold the filed reports, their index and the shipped counts to each
  other. [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#sending-a-compatibility-report) says how to send one.
- **On the wire.** The bridge's `compatibility` and `compat-refresh` views carry `reported` - its
  state and five counts, every key always there - and `control/wire.py` names it
  (`CompatReported`). The MCP replies do not change.

### Two claims corrected

- **A check box that could never do anything is gone.** *Sign-in service failures*
  (`auth_service_transient`) sat under Automatic recovery from v0.6.3, with a Custom message and a
  place in the Preview, for a kind of interruption nothing produced: no error code, HTTP status or
  message Codex records was ever classified as it. v0.6.3's entry below and the guide said it had been
  recovered through v0.6.2 with no way to turn it off; it never was. The check box, its Custom message,
  its place in the Preview and its switch in `update_settings` are gone from the Dashboard, the panel
  and the MCP schema. The word stays, so a record that names it still reads, and a settings file that
  carries `recover_auth_service_transient` or its Custom message loads as before, the two keys dropped;
  a write that names either is refused. A test now fails if a kind nothing produces is made
  recoverable again, and this one comes back only when a real Codex error is seen to carry it. On the
  wire, every reply that carries the settings or their schema has the two fields fewer, the Preview's
  kinds one fewer, and the two continuation sentences for it left the nine catalogs; the wire goldens
  were regenerated on purpose.
- **Start watcher, asked from Codex, says how long the watcher will run.** A watcher started with
  the panel's Start watcher or the `start_watcher` tool runs in the job Codex runs this plugin's
  server in, and Codex 26.915 ends everything in that job when it ends the server - measured for
  v0.6.9-alpha. The reply said *The watcher is running.* as though it would stay. Now, where the job
  ends what it holds, it adds that the watcher stops when Codex closes, if not sooner, and how to get
  one that outlives Codex: once Codex has closed, open Codex Auto Resume from the Start menu and start
  it there, or turn on Run at Windows sign-in in the Dashboard. (Not the Dashboard opened from that
  watcher's own icon: it runs inside Codex's job too, and while the watcher runs it has nothing to
  start.) Where Windows will not describe the job, it says the watcher may stop, with the same way
  out. The panel says the same in all nine languages, after a start that is running or not yet
  confirmed, and the tool's description says it too. The reply carries `ends_with_codex` - true,
  false or null, read from the job each time - whenever it started a watcher, and the MCP wire golden
  now holds a start in such a job and one in no job. The job is read by the one function the start
  with Codex refuses by.

### The groundwork: where every file goes when the core is Rust

A stage of v0.6.10 that changes nothing a person can see but the version it names; it went out first as the pre-release v0.6.10-alpha. The window draws what it drew, the popup renders the same pixels, the panel serves the same script, and every reply on the wire carries the same fields - `tests/golden/` holds each one to the byte.

`docs/ROADMAP.md` plans to replace the Python core with Rust under one rule - **replace the
implementation, not the behavior** - and names the eight parts it is built from. That rule can only
be kept if each part's behaviour is in one place first: a file that does two parts' work is read
twice, ported twice and kept in step twice, and the second port is where behaviour quietly changes.
This release is that groundwork.

#### The map

`tests/test_stack.py` places every module on exactly one of the eight Rust parts, on one of the
parts the Windows interface keeps, or on the few that are neither, and holds the placement four
ways, each of which only ever shrinks: parts with no package of their own, packages that hold two
parts, single modules that do two parts' work, and the graph of which part calls which. An entry
that stops being true fails the test, so the lists cannot go stale while the tree moves.
`tests/test_layers.py` has held the direction of every import since v0.6.5; this is the other
question - not which way a call points, but which binary the code ends up inside.


#### The Python package, in the plan's layout

The layout the v0.6.5 plan drew is the tree now: `domain/ store/ codex/ compat/ win/ engine/
control/ mcp/ commands/ runtime/ ui/`. What moved in this release, each by line range and never
retyped, each old module kept as a front that re-exports every name it had:

- `windows.py` (989 lines, two parts at once) is the Codex adapter in `codex/` - `transport.py`,
  `appserver.py`, `pairing.py`, `usage.py` - and the Windows platform in `win/` - `kernel.py`,
  `sync.py`, `homelock.py`, `inventory.py`.
- `machine.py` is `domain/states.py`, `domain/gates.py` and `domain/public.py`: the stored states,
  the gates a record passes before anything is sent, and what a person is shown. Its docstring had
  always called them "three layers, kept apart on purpose".
- `app.py` is `runtime/`: the composition root, the watcher's loop, and the toasts it raises. The
  watcher has a package of its own for the first time.
- `cli.py` is the parser and the command table; the fifteen command bodies are `commands/`.
- `compat.py` and `compatio.py` are `compat/`, nine files: the registry's model, what a document
  says about a version, the report, what may be done at a tier, and the io half.
- `notice_window.py`, the notification card's window code, is `ui/card/`, beside the icon and the
  popup.
- Before this: `store/`, `engine/`, `control/`, `brand/`, `codex/`, `ui/popup/`, `ui/tray/` and
  `mcp/`, and the popup's, panel's and server's large files.

#### The window, in nineteen files

`gui/Controls.cs` was 6,753 lines; `gui/SettingsApp.cs` and `gui/Dashboard.cs` were 4,150 and
4,353, holding one `partial class` in four declarations. They are nineteen sources now: the
Settings half, the Dashboard half, the soft controls both are drawn with, and the generated
palette. Every type and member moved as its own text; the compiler is handed the same code, and
the pictures are byte for byte what they were. `gui/window.sources` is the compile list and the only
place it is written, divided into `[settings]`, `[dashboard]`, `[controls]` and `[generated]`, and
every rule the suite holds the window's code to asks for a group rather than a file.


#### The wire, as types

`control/wire.py` writes down the shapes the control layer hands every surface - a record, a row of
Pending or History, the watcher, the status, the statistics, the Compatibility card's view, a
setting as `describe` publishes it - as twelve typed contracts. `tests/test_wire_types.py` holds each
one to the golden replies both ways: every key on the wire is declared, every declared key is on the
wire, and every value fits its type. 144 fields the window reads are held to a declared key. These
are what a Rust port declares as structs, and they keep what a port would be tempted to lose:
"cannot tell" as its own value where a question can go unanswered, and not as false.


#### Found while doing it

Splitting a module into a package fails in ways that say nothing at the time, and this release
built a test for each before moving anything - `tests/test_names.py`, `tests/test_reexports.py`,
`tests/guiscan.py` - and then an adversarial review of the result. What they found before any of
it reached anyone:

- A relative import inside a moved function means something else one package level down. In the
  Codex adapter it made the list of versions the bundled registry verifies silently empty; in the
  watcher's composition root it would have started the watcher without its notification-area icon.
  Every in-function import in moved code is now rewritten a level up, and `tests/test_names.py`
  fails on one that names a module that is not there.
- A test patch aimed at a front reaches nothing. Five tests had been checking the real thing instead
  of the stand-in they named - the installer's lock among them - and are aimed at the module that
  looks each name up.
- The release build would have failed copying the moved documents, and the picture generator's
  fake Codex reached no process.
- The wire goldens read the live compatibility data, so any data publish broke the suite; the first
  one since they were made did. They read the frozen copy now. (This one is also on `main`.)

## v0.6.10-alpha — Where every file goes when the core is Rust

[The commits in this pre-release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.9...v0.6.10-alpha)

**A pre-release, published from `main`.** It is a GitHub pre-release, so `releases/latest` never
answers with it and an installed copy's update check never offers it. It is on `main`, though, and
the plugin's own route installs what `main`'s manifest says, so an installation made that way gets
it - and behaves as v0.6.9 did. It is here because it is a stage the v0.6.10 work has to be split
into and is not a release on its own: nothing a person can see changes but the version it names. The window draws what it drew, the popup renders the same pixels, the panel serves the
same script, and every reply on the wire carries the same fields - `tests/golden/` holds each one
to the byte. To leave it, run `Install.cmd` from any later release's archive.

`docs/ROADMAP.md` says v0.6.13 replaces the Python core with Rust under one rule - **replace the
implementation, not the behavior** - and names the eight parts it is built from. That rule can only
be kept if each part's behaviour is in one place first: a file that does two parts' work is read
twice, ported twice and kept in step twice, and the second port is where behaviour quietly changes.
This release is that groundwork.

### The map

`tests/test_stack.py` places every module on exactly one of the eight Rust parts, on one of the
parts the Windows interface keeps, or on the few that are neither, and holds the placement four
ways, each of which only ever shrinks: parts with no package of their own, packages that hold two
parts, single modules that do two parts' work, and the graph of which part calls which. An entry
that stops being true fails the test, so the lists cannot go stale while the tree moves.
`tests/test_layers.py` has held the direction of every import since v0.6.5; this is the other

### The Python package, in the plan's layout

The layout the v0.6.5 plan drew is the tree now: `domain/ store/ codex/ compat/ win/ engine/
control/ mcp/ commands/ runtime/ ui/`. What moved in this release, each by line range and never
retyped, each old module kept as a front that re-exports every name it had:

- `windows.py` (989 lines, two parts at once) is the Codex adapter in `codex/` - `transport.py`,
  `appserver.py`, `pairing.py`, `usage.py` - and the Windows platform in `win/` - `kernel.py`,
  `sync.py`, `homelock.py`, `inventory.py`.
- `machine.py` is `domain/states.py`, `domain/gates.py` and `domain/public.py`: the stored states,
  the gates a record passes before anything is sent, and what a person is shown. Its docstring had
  always called them "three layers, kept apart on purpose".
- `app.py` is `runtime/`: the composition root, the watcher's loop, and the toasts it raises. The
  watcher has a package of its own for the first time.
- `cli.py` is the parser and the command table; the fifteen command bodies are `commands/`.

- `notice_window.py`, the notification card's window code, is `ui/card/`, beside the icon and the
  popup.
- Before this: `store/`, `engine/`, `control/`, `brand/`, `codex/`, `ui/popup/`, `ui/tray/` and
  `mcp/`, and the popup's, panel's and server's large files.

No module is over the 700-line budget now, down from ten, and none does two parts' work. And the
product has no import cycle left: the last one ran through the registry, and closed when the adapter began
reading the bundled registry from the file that holds it rather than through a front that loaded
all of it.

### The window, in nineteen files

`gui/Controls.cs` was 6,753 lines; `gui/SettingsApp.cs` and `gui/Dashboard.cs` were 4,150 and
4,353, holding one `partial class` in four declarations. They are nineteen sources now: the
Settings half, the Dashboard half, the soft controls both are drawn with, and the generated
palette. Every type and member moved as its own text; the compiler is handed the same code, and
the pictures are byte for byte what they were. `gui/window.sources` is the compile list and the only
place it is written, divided into `[settings]`, `[dashboard]`, `[controls]` and `[generated]`, and
every rule the suite holds the window's code to asks for a group rather than a file.

### The wire, as types

`control/wire.py` writes down the shapes the control layer hands every surface - a record, a row of
Pending or History, the watcher, the status, the statistics, the Compatibility card's view, a
setting as `describe` publishes it - as twelve typed contracts. `tests/test_wire_types.py` holds each
one to the golden replies both ways: every key on the wire is declared, every declared key is on the
wire, and every value fits its type. 144 fields the window reads are held to a declared key. These
are what a Rust port declares as structs, and they keep what a port would be tempted to lose:
"cannot tell" as its own value where a question can go unanswered, and not as false.

### Found while doing it

Splitting a module into a package fails in ways that say nothing at the time, and this release
built a test for each before moving anything - `tests/test_names.py`, `tests/test_reexports.py`,
`tests/guiscan.py` - and then an adversarial review of the result. What they found before any of

### The repository's front page

`CONTRIBUTING`, `SECURITY` and `SUPPORT` moved to `docs/`, in both languages. GitHub reads all three
from there, so its security policy tab and the contributing link on a new issue are unchanged, and
the list of files above the README is thirteen instead of nineteen.

## v0.6.9 — The window stops making you wait, and a question answered by measuring

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.8...v0.6.9)

### The window is faster, and looks exactly the same

The window lagged, worst on some pages, and it was worse in every language but English. It was not
drawing too much - it was doing the same work again and again:

- The watcher's snapshot arrives every five seconds whether or not anything moved, and every time it
  did, both lists rewrote every cell, invalidated themselves and re-measured up to 200 rows across
  six columns - on pages nobody was looking at, because a snapshot is applied to every page that has
  been built. The thirteen safety checks on Pending were rebuilt the same way, each rebuild handing
  its card a full layout. Now each keeps a signature of what it drew, and identical rows and checks
  are nothing to do.
- Text was measured over and over: a label that wraps Korean never reached Windows' own measurement
  cache, so every layout pass measured it again, and the cache that holds a wrapped line was smaller
  than the Korean catalog, so it emptied itself in the middle of a page. Measurements are cached now,
  and the wrap cache is eight times larger.
- The countdowns were written into the Pending list every second whether or not that page was in
  front; they are written where they can be seen, and once when it comes back.
- Saving any setting - a theme, a limit - threw away the cache of the window's own words, so the next
  open waited on a fresh interpreter. Only the Interface language does that now.
- The shadow templates dropped all 128 of them on overflow and re-blurred everything; the oldest half
  goes instead. A visibility check on a dozen hot paths went through reflection on every call; it is
  bound once. A list drew two new brushes for every cell of every row, on every repaint; one brush
  per colour is kept.

Measured on the real compiled window, laying out every page and section, median of three runs:

| | before | after |
| --- | --- | --- |
| English, 100% | 5.6 s | 2.8 s |
| English, 150% | 6.4 s | 2.8 s |
| Korean, 100% | 17.3 s | 3.5 s |
| Korean, 150% | 13.3 s | 3.7 s |

Korean was three times English; it is about a fifth slower now. **Nothing about the design changed.**
Not a shadow, not a radius, not a light: the speed comes from doing the work once, not from drawing
less. The pictures in this repository are made again from the same window, and the suite reads their
pixels - the cards, the hairlines, the status light - as it always has.

### Starting with Codex: asked, built, measured, and not shipped

Starting the watcher when Codex starts - rather than only at Windows sign-in - was built for
v0.6.9-alpha and measured on a real machine, because two things about it cannot be read out of any
source. Codex 26.915 answered both: it starts a plugin's MCP server about 22 seconds after the app
opens, several times, and cancels each within seconds; and it runs each one inside a Windows job
object that ends everything that server started and forbids leaving it. Six starts were measured; six
watchers, each dead within about six seconds.

A watcher that is killed seconds after it starts, again and again, is the opposite of what this
product is - one stopped mid-tick cannot prove whether it sent a continuation. So the switch is not
offered. The code refuses where the job would end the watcher, and writes what the job said to
`logs\codex-start.log`, so the next Codex is one line away from being measured again. The advanced
edition (v0.6.11) is where starting a process outside the host's job belongs, for a person who turns
it on.

What was built for it stays in the code, and refuses where the job would end the watcher. It starts the watcher from
this plugin's MCP server when none is running, through the same launcher sign-in uses and never while an installation
holds its lock. Codex starts the server more than once as it opens, so two of them can ask at the same moment; the
watcher's own single-instance mutex answers that, and the second one exits without doing anything. Nothing new is
registered with Windows for it: no scheduled task, no subscription, no process left resident to wait for Codex. Each
time Codex starts the server, one line goes into `logs\codex-start.log`: what Windows wrapped that process in, and
what was decided. It carries no path, no name and nothing from a conversation.

### The waiting light breathes, and the pictures show the right light

A light that says the watcher is waiting for a reset held lit and still, while the notification-area
icon - which draws that same state as watching - kept moving. It breathes now, on watching's rhythm,
in the Dashboard, the panel in Codex, the notification-area popup and the notification card. And the
animated pictures breathed the wrong dot: in the panel's they moved the small dot in the Automatic
recovery tile, which never moves in the product, while the status light at the top stayed still. The
generator takes the topmost light now, at any point of its breath, and the notification card's
picture breathes with the rest.

### Also here

- Codex ignores a plugin's suggested prompts entirely when there are more than three, and this one
  offered four, so none of them ever appeared. It offers three.
- The README is the short version - what it does, how to install it, the one limitation, where
  everything else is - and everything it used to hold is in [the guide](GUIDE.md).
- The roadmap gives the design audit and the choice of appearance a release of their own (v0.6.10's
  final), which moves the advanced features and the two editions to v0.6.11 and everything after it
  one number on.

## v0.6.9-alpha — Starting with Codex, measured

[The commits in this pre-release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.8...v0.6.9-alpha)

**A pre-release, and nothing is served it.** It is published from the `dev` branch as a GitHub
pre-release, so `releases/latest` never answers with it and no installation is offered it; the
plugin's own route installs what `main` says, which is still v0.6.8. It is here because two facts
about starting with Codex can only be measured on a machine running the real thing. To leave it,
run `Install.cmd` from any later release's archive.

### Start when Codex starts

The watcher has always started when you sign in to Windows. This adds the other choice: start it
when Codex starts. Codex starts this plugin's MCP server whenever it opens, so that server starts
the watcher when none is running - through the same launcher sign-in uses, only while the switch is
on and never while an installation holds its lock. Codex starts the server more than once as it
opens, so two of them can ask at the same moment; the watcher's own single-instance mutex answers
that, and the second one exits without doing anything. Nothing new is registered with Windows for
it: no scheduled task, no subscription, no process left resident to wait for Codex.
The switch is off until you turn it on, in the Dashboard under Settings > Windows; it is not offered
to Codex, so nothing a model does can turn it on.

Each time Codex starts the server, one line goes into `logs\codex-start.log`: what Windows wrapped
that process in, and what was decided. It carries no path, no name and nothing from a conversation.

### The waiting light breathes

A light that says the watcher is waiting for a reset held lit and still, while the notification-area
icon - which draws that same state as watching - kept moving. It breathes now, on watching's rhythm,
in the Dashboard, the panel in Codex, the notification-area popup and the notification card. Only the
word beside it tells waiting and watching apart, as the icon has always had it.

### The panel's picture shows the right light

The animated pictures of the panel breathed the small dot in the Automatic recovery tile - which does
not move in the product - and left the status light at the top still. The generator now animates the
topmost status light on each surface, which is the one the product moves.

### Also here

- Codex accepts at most three suggested prompts and ignores the lot when there are more; this plugin
  offered four, so none of them ever appeared. It offers three.
- The README is the short version, and everything it used to hold is in `docs/GUIDE.md`.

The archive's digest is in the release notes on GitHub; a pre-release is not pinned in
`scripts/release.json`, so the bootstrap checks it against the published `.sha256` beside it and
says so.

## v0.6.8 — A tray icon without its badge, and lights that never stop

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.7...v0.6.8)

Three things about lights, each asked for by name, and nothing about what recovery does.

### One icon, not two

The notification-area icon wore a small status dot in its bottom-right corner - cyan while a
recovery ran, amber for attention, grey when paused - that the settings window's taskbar button
never had. So during a recovery the tray showed a second light beside the mark's own moving head,
and the two icons looked as if they said different things. The dot is gone. The head of the mark
alone says the state, as it already did on the taskbar button, and the tray icon and the taskbar
button are the same picture, frame for frame. The states are still told apart by the head: its
colour, its breath and its sweep.

### Lights that never stop

Needing attention and a failure each pulsed once when they appeared and then held still. Now neither
stops for as long as it lasts, with the same curve and glow as every other light:

- **Needing attention** breathes slowly - every 5.6 seconds, slower than monitoring's 4.4 - in amber.
- **A failure** breathes quickly - every 1.2 seconds, quicker than a recovery's 2.8 - in red. On the
  tray icon and the taskbar button its head sweeps out along the ring and back as a recovery's does,
  twice as quickly - once every 1.98 seconds - and blinks as it goes, on that same 1.2-second breath:
  the one state whose head breathes while it travels.

The window, the notification-area popup, the panel in Codex, the notification card, the tray icon
and the taskbar button all take it from one table. Reduce motion, Windows' animation setting and High
Contrast still hold every light still.

### Red until you have seen it

Until now nothing ever put the tray icon or the taskbar button in the failed state: a failed
recovery was red on its notification card and in the lists' state chips, and never on either icon. Now a recovery that ends in a certain failure
turns both red, sweeping, and they stay red until you have seen it - click the icon to open the
popup, or bring the Dashboard to the front - or until a recovery is on its way afterwards (one that
is handed back before anything is sent does not count). Hovering over
the icon says *A recovery failed*, in all nine languages. When you last saw a failure is kept as one
time in `config/failure-seen.json`, which the watcher sets when it starts, so failures from before
this update never turn the icon red; PRIVACY.md lists what it holds.

### Also

- The README's picture of the icon's motion has a fifth column, the failed icon sweeping, and no
  badges.
- The roadmap: **v0.6.9** is the window's lag, on its own. **v0.6.10-alpha**, a pre-release, is the
  Python modularization and nothing else; the final **v0.6.10** is advanced features - as many as any
  program like this offers, and more: everything the product does today keeps today's constraints,
  and everything they made impossible is built, off until you turn it on - in an advanced edition
  released beside the standard one, which does not contain that code at all. **v0.6.11** is the bug
  hunt over both editions, the last Python release. **v0.6.12-alpha** replaces the core with Rust as it
  is, the final **v0.6.12** makes it Rust-native, and **v0.6.13** is the Rust bug hunt. A pre-release
  is only ever a stage the work has to be split into that is not a release on its own.

## v0.6.7 — Compatibility in tiers, Failed here, and a notification card that breathes

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.6...v0.6.7)

What the compatibility data can say grew by one word, what a failure can say grew by one more, and the
notification card's light now does what every other light does. Nothing about recovery changed: the
same classifier, the same gates, the same one watcher that is the only thing allowed to send.

### Verified, Checked, Compatible

Each capability, for the exact Codex version on this computer, is now one of six states rather than
four, in this order:

- **Verified** - a real recovery on this exact Codex version exercised the capability, and none failed it.
- **Checked** - new: the maintainer's local checks passed on this exact version, and nothing confirmed more.
- **Compatible** - the data says nothing about this version, and this computer's own checks pass.
- **Failed here**, **Incompatible** and **Unknown**, below.

The two rules are the ones v0.6.5 introduced. A failed local check always wins, and the data can only
restrict, or raise a local pass - now to Checked or to Verified - for an exact version. A Checked
capability needs a cited recording, as a Verified one does, and stops counting when a fetched copy
expires. It sends exactly as a Compatible or a Verified one does; only the advanced tier, which nothing
offers yet, still asks for Verified alone. The window's Diagnostics card, the panel in Codex, `status`,
`doctor` and the watcher's log say the new word in all nine languages, and the word the watcher's gate
reads for an engine can now be `checked`.

### Failed here

A local check that fails on a version the data checked or verified used to read as Incompatible, the
same word as a Codex version that does not work. It reads **Failed here** now: the data vouches for
that version, so the cause is most likely this computer - where Codex is installed, a file it is
missing - and not the Codex version. It holds every send and refuses every capability exactly as
Incompatible does, the watcher's engine state reads `failed_here`, the Diagnostics card shows the part
in the blocking tone, and a waiting interruption carries its own overlay, *Codex checks failed on this
computer*, which makes the popup and the notification-area icon ask for attention. A local failure on
a version nobody has checked, and a version the data marks incompatible, are still Incompatible.

### Older releases take the newer data

The data on `main` is fetched by every installation, whichever release it runs. v0.6.5 and v0.6.6 take
data carrying Checked claims whole: their validator passes over a state it does not know, so nothing
they decide moves, and a Verified claim reaches them as it always did. The suite now proves it with
their own code rather than by reading it: `OlderReleasesTests` loads each release's `compat.py` from
its tag and runs it on the data. The tool that publishes the data checks the same way before it opens
anything.

### The notification card breathes

The card's status light is the popup's now: it breathes on the one table the window, the popup and the
panel breathe on - a breath every 4.4 s while monitoring and every 2.8 s while recovering - a problem
pulses once and then holds lit, and an interruption waiting for its reset holds lit and still, as it
does everywhere. The card's face is drawn again for the light at most every 80 ms. Reduce motion and
High Contrast hold it lit and still with no glow, which is what v0.6.6 drew for every card on purpose.
`notice_window.py` grew by seven lines for it, and its line ceiling was raised to match: the split that
brings those ceilings down is v0.6.8.

### Compatibility data between releases

The data file on `main` is live: it changes whenever compatibility data is published, between releases.
The behaviour tests and the documentation's pictures read v0.6.6's bundled document, frozen beside them
(`tests/fixtures/codex_compat_frozen.json`), so a publication cannot turn `main` red or mark a picture
stale; `BundledBaselineTests` still hold the live file to its rules. The first publication since v0.6.6
verified codex-cli 0.153.4, 0.154.0-alpha.6.2 and 0.155.0-alpha.9.2 and checked 0.155.0-alpha.2.6,
each from one machine's own records of real recoveries, with the recordings under `docs/evidence/compat/`.

### Fixed

- **Main went red once on the commit a release is tagged at.** The check that a tagged version's digest
  is pinned now skips the commit the tag points at, which cannot carry its own digest; a later commit
  without the pin still fails.

### Documents

- The roadmap's planned releases each move one number on: the Python modularization that was v0.6.7 is
  v0.6.8, the GitHub landing-page tidy goes with it, and everything after follows.
- The feature matrix, the security and support notes, the brand document, the README and the plugin,
  live-acceptance and verification guides say the six states and the breathing card, in English and Korean.

### Evidence

Everything below was run on one Windows 11 machine (Home, build 26200, Korean system language). The
suite passes on this tree; the tests named above are the ones that hold each change: `ResolveTests`,
`PermitTests`, `EvaluatorTests`, `CardTests`, `OlderReleasesTests`, `BundledBaselineTests` and the
card's two light tests. The pictures were made again for this version.

Not verified, and not claimed: a real Codex showing Checked or Failed here, which needs a version the
data checks on a computer whose check fails; the card's light breathing on a real desktop, which is
drawn off-screen and read at single moments; and the Failed here overlay asked for by a test.

## v0.6.6 — A status light that breathes, a taskbar button that moves where it is installed, a theme of the panel's own, and pictures that show it

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.5...v0.6.6)

What a day of real use turned up. Nothing about recovery changed: the same classifier, the same
gates, the same one watcher that is the only thing allowed to send. One new setting, the panel's
own theme, whose default changes nothing.

### The status light is the ordinary breath now

Three cuts were wrong in three directions, and each was named: v0.6.4's glow was too big, v0.6.5's
blink too quick and too hard, and this release's first answer - a smaller swing - too faint to see.
The fourth is how a status light of this size is ordinarily built, and nothing of ours:

- **One cycle near a resting breath**, 4.4 s, about fourteen a minute. Recovering runs it every
  2.8 s; a problem runs it once, over 1.4 s, and then holds lit.
- **One symmetric cosine across the whole cycle**, so the light is never not moving and has a
  corner nowhere - half of it down, half back.
- **A deep swing**: the dot keeps 35% of its light at the bottom, 62% of its colour as drawn.
  Gentleness comes from the speed and the curve, not from a small swing, which is what the first
  answer got backwards.
- **Taken in light and drawn through the screen's gamma**, because a cosine walked straight along
  an alpha bunches at the top and rushes at the bottom.
- **A glow that rides the brightness** rather than taking a turn of its own: out at the top at
  opacity 0.50, gone at the bottom.
- **A reach that is a share of the dot**, 0.6 of its radius, rather than the flat 3 px it had been
  - which was two thirds of the popup's radius and half of the panel's, the same light in two
  strengths. The window's is unchanged at 3 px; the panel's is 3.6 and the popup's 2.7.

One table serves every surface, so the window, the notification-area popup and the panel in Codex
breathe alike; the notification card draws its light from the same table at one moment of the
breath, because a card that is on the screen for a few seconds does not breathe at all. The
notification-area icon and the window's taskbar button read the same rhythm, so the mark's head
breathes with it and its sweep comes every 22 s rather than every 16 s; the head keeps its own
deeper fall, because sixteen pixels need it.

### The last controls that were not ours

Two native controls were still showing through the design, and a third was ours only where somebody
had remembered to ask for it.

- **Every scroll bar is the product's own**, wherever one appears and on either axis. The panel's
  rules had been written for one class - the drop-down's list - so a wide table, a long page or any
  box added later got the browser's grey; they are global now, with a corner and a Firefox
  fallback. In the window the message box was the last control still scrolling on Windows' bar: it
  keeps that bar, because that is what scrolls the text and what the wheel and the keys talk to,
  and hides it outside a clip, while ours is drawn in the gutter that leaves, from the box's own
  scroll position, exactly as a list's is.
- **A scroll bar's track takes its colour from the ground it runs over.** Over a card the groove is
  `inset`, as it always was; in a well that is itself `inset` - the message box - an inset track
  would be the ground and the pill would float on nothing, so there it is `surface`. High Contrast
  keeps its system colours either way.
- **Windows' message box is gone from the window.** Fourteen of the fifteen are now a dialog in the
  material the rest of the window is made of, and they say what will happen: instead of "Yes" and
  "No", which name nothing, the affirming button carries the words of the button that was pressed
  to ask - *Clear history*, *Stop watcher*, *Install* - beside Cancel, which is the pattern the
  panel settled first. The fifteenth is kept on purpose: it is raised before there is a window, a
  theme or a catalog, to say that nothing is installed in that location.
- **Every drop-down the panel makes is the panel's own**, which was true and is now held to by a
  test that reads each one by name rather than counting them.

Deliberately unchanged: the notification area's right-click menu, which Windows draws and which
already follows the theme, and the file picker the diagnostics export opens, which is the one every
other application opens.

### The panel in Codex has a theme of its own

The panel sits inside Codex and everything else sits on Windows. *Use system setting* already let
each follow its own host, but a Light or Dark Theme drew them all alike: nobody could keep the window
dark and let the panel follow Codex, or pin the panel whatever Codex does. **Theme in Codex**, under
Settings > Appearance right under the Theme, is the panel's own: *Same as Theme*, *Codex's theme*,
*Light* or *Dark*.

- *Same as Theme* is the default, and it is exactly what every panel did before: the Theme's choice,
  with *Use system setting* following Codex there as it always has. An upgrade changes nothing
  anybody can see; the new setting only matters once somebody chooses it.
- The Theme itself now draws the window, the popup and the notification card, and draws the panel
  only while Theme in Codex is Same as Theme. Its help in both places says so.
- It is offered in the window and in the panel, and Codex may change it too (`panel_theme` in the
  settings tool). A save sends it only when it was changed where the save was made, as the Theme and
  the Interface language are sent, so one changed elsewhere is not put back.
- A watcher too old to know the setting sends none, and the panel draws itself in the Theme's choice,
  as it did. A value it does not know is Same as Theme.
- Its words are in all nine languages, and the Theme's help is rewritten in all nine, because it no
  longer colours the panel outright.

### The documentation moves

- The pictures a reader meets first are animated PNGs now: every dashboard page, the settings
  window, the panel in Codex and the notification-area popup, in each language, with their status
  light redrawn from `brand.glow` at the rate the window itself repaints. Nothing else in them
  moves, they keep every colour they had, and a viewer without animation sees the still picture
  that was always there.
- The icon's motion and the light's own picture are animated PNGs too, in place of the GIFs they
  were: a GIF holds 256 colours, which is not enough for the badge's gradient or the card's
  ground.
- The pictures are the light theme's only. The dark theme is described rather than pictured, which
  halves what a reader scrolls past.
- **Every window picture had a black band down each side and along its bottom** - 11 px at 100%,
  16 at 150% - and nobody had looked at the edge of a 1522-pixel picture. It was not the window:
  `PrintWindow` returns the window without its frame, because the frame is Windows' to draw, and
  the bitmap it is drawn into starts black. The picture is now cut to what was actually drawn,
  measured from the window's own client rectangle.
- **And the corners Windows rounds are rounded in the picture**, at the system's own radius for
  this window's DPI, left transparent so the page behind shows through them. A screenshot of a
  Windows 11 window with square corners is a screenshot of a window nobody has.

### The taskbar button moves where it is installed

- v0.6.5 moved the mark on the window's taskbar button, and on an installed window it never moved
  once. Measured here: the published executable, byte for byte, moved the button from a scratch
  folder and did not move it from the installed one, where an instrumented build showed the window
  setting frame after frame into a button that stayed pixel-identical for twenty-four seconds.
  What decides it is where the window is installed, not what it does: Windows files an installed
  window under the application registered at that location and paints its button from that
  application's icon, which no window can change. A Start Menu shortcut alone does not do it - one
  written for a scratch folder, with the same identity and the same icon, left the button moving.
- The window now asks Windows to file it under an identity of its own, which nothing registers, and
  the button falls back to the icon the window itself sets. With that one call the same build moved
  74 of 163 filmed frames in the installed location. Notifications are unaffected: they are raised
  by the watcher under the watcher's own AppUserModelID, which is what makes them attributable.
- The notification-area icon is unchanged, including where it holds still on purpose: an icon
  Windows keeps in the overflow flyout does not move, because nobody sees it there. Dragging it onto
  the taskbar brings its motion back within a second.

### Documents

- The changelog, the roadmap, the brand notes and the feature matrix carry the new numbers, in
  English and Korean. The roadmap's planned releases each move one number on: the Python
  modularization that was v0.6.6 is v0.6.7, and everything after it follows.

### Two builds before this one

v0.6.6 was published twice before this, and both builds are kept as pre-releases, each on a release
page of its own and with an entry of its own right after this one in the changelog:
[`v0.6.6-beta`](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases/tag/v0.6.6-beta), the build announced as `v0.6.6` on 2026-09-20, and
[`v0.6.6-alpha`](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases/tag/v0.6.6-alpha), the first candidate. All three archives are called `CodexAutoResume-v0.6.6-win-x64.zip`, because
renaming a tag does not rename what is already attached to a release - the same name for different
bytes. The digest pinned in `scripts/release.json` is this release's, and it is the one to check
against.

#### v0.6.6-beta

**A pre-release, kept on [its own page](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases/tag/v0.6.6-beta).** Built from `b17076d`, published and
announced as `v0.6.6` on 2026-09-20 and renamed `v0.6.6-beta` on 2026-09-21. It went out without the panel's own
theme, which was asked for the same day, so v0.6.6 was cut a third time. Its notes are v0.6.6's
above less *The panel in Codex has a theme of its own*: the ordinary breath, the taskbar button that
moves where it is installed, the product's own scroll bars and dialog, and the pictures cut to the
window. Its evidence was measured on its own tree: 2,572 tests, and a window built twice to
`c572844e…`, 387,072 bytes.

- It was announced, so it is said plainly: **the tag `v0.6.6` has named three archives**, and this
  was the first announced under it. Its digest is
  `e620280bd5b40ad354d767fe22dd65ec8ed3eefe6b2f0af20d20759fca7e81a3`; `scripts/release.json` pins v0.6.6's, so a copy taken from the beta's page fails the
  comparison, which is the comparison doing its job.
- Nothing is served it: the update check reads the tag out of the URL `releases/latest` ends at and
  accepts `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` alone. A machine running it keeps it and is not moved back to v0.6.5.
  Because the number is the same, the update check does not offer it v0.6.6 either: the v0.6.6
  archive's `Install.cmd` installs over it, and so does the setup script given `-Force`.

#### v0.6.6-alpha

**A pre-release, kept on [its own page](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases/tag/v0.6.6-alpha).** Built from `f63d904`, tagged
`v0.6.6` and published on 2026-09-20, then stopped before it was announced: its gentler light - a
smaller swing - was too faint to see, and the scroll bars, the dialog and the pictures' edges had not
been made the product's own yet. It carried two things: a slower, shallower status light (a 4.4 s
cycle, the dot dimming 38% of the way rather than 60%, the glow peaking at 0.30), and the taskbar
button that moves where it is installed, which v0.6.6 carries too.

- Its archive is called `CodexAutoResume-v0.6.6-win-x64.zip` as well, and its digest is
  `3b99217b084148111d07cfc51c9ad8f5bddb6fd50029979ed1b1b6796be0b956`. Nothing is served it, for the same reason as the beta.

### Evidence

Everything below was run on one Windows 11 machine (Home, build 26200, 3840 x 2160 at 150%, Korean
system language, Windows' apps set to dark and the product's Theme set to Light). The suite, the
build, the archive, the light, the pictures, the dialog and the panel's own theme were measured on
this tree. Two things were measured on the first candidate, `v0.6.6-alpha`, and not again: the
taskbar button filmed in the installed location, whose code has not changed since by a byte, and
the upgrade over v0.6.5, which this release made over the beta instead.

- **The suite.** 2,580 tests, no failures, under Python 3.13 here (900 s, 8 skipped), and green on
  GitHub's Windows runners for 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 and 3.15. The skips are the opt-in live checks and
  the pin check that waits for the tag.
- **The window, built here and on GitHub.** The `CodexAutoResumeSettings.exe` built from these
  sources on this machine and the one GitHub's runner built into the published archive are
  byte-identical (`db7257ee…`, 388,096 bytes). The archive's own digest is not written here - this
  file ships inside the archive, so naming it would change it - it is published beside the release
  and pinned in `scripts/release.json` afterwards, which is what `docs/VERIFY.md` compares.
- **The taskbar button, in the installed location.** This is the claim v0.6.5 could not make. With
  v0.6.6 installed over v0.6.5 here, the window's button was filmed at ten frames a second for
  twenty-four seconds: 92 of 198 frames differ from the one before, and the mark's head is at
  different places and brightnesses through the loop. The same measurement on the published v0.6.5
  build, in the same place, found not one changed pixel in twenty-four seconds; the same executable
  moved the button from a scratch folder. An instrumented build showed the window setting frames
  throughout (state=watching, allowed=True, interval 156 then 62) - the frames simply never reached
  the button.
- **Installed on this machine.** The first candidate was installed over v0.6.5: the installer
  answered *Updated. Your settings and pending recoveries were kept.*; `config\settings.json` was
  byte for byte what it had been; the watcher restarted and reported 0.6.6. This release was
  installed over the beta from its own archive's `Install.cmd`, with the same answer; the 154
  files it installed are byte for byte the archive's, and the watcher restarted on them.
- **The archive.** `build/smoke_archive.py` passed every check on the published archive, including that both
  executables report 0.6.6 and that this machine's registrations and state were left as they were.
- **The light.** Its numbers are held by the suite on the drawn pixels of every surface - the
  window, the popup, the panel and the card - and every picture in the documentation was drawn
  again from the new table by the product's own code, in the five languages they are made in, in the light theme.
- **The icon's motion.** The animated PNG in the documentation is composed from the icon's own
  frames at the new rhythm, and the suite holds every frame of it against the icon's table.
- **The pictures' edges.** Every window picture is 22 px narrower and 11 shorter than it was: the
  frame Windows draws and PrintWindow does not is gone, measured away rather than trimmed by eye,
  and the four corners Windows rounds are rounded and clear, which the suite reads off the pixels.
- **The dialog.** It is opened for real by the suite - the compiled window, a dialog asked for, a
  timer that reads it while it is up and presses one of its buttons - and what is read back is where
  the buttons are, which one Enter and Escape press, that it belongs to the window and carries no
  second button on the taskbar, and the answer each press gave. Nobody has yet used it with a screen
  reader, and no capture shows it.
- **Theme in Codex.** The panel's own `applyTheme` is run in Node over thirteen pairs of the two
  themes, and the panel's row is driven there: its four choices, a save that sends it alone, and
  the stamp changing in place. The compiled window is driven too - it sends the setting only when
  it was changed there, and its drop-down follows a change made in the panel or by Codex. The
  settings panel's picture shows the row, in the five languages the pictures are made in.

Not verified, and not claimed: the notification-area icon's own motion on this machine (Windows
keeps it in the overflow flyout, where this release still holds it still on purpose); High Contrast
on a real system; a real Codex interruption recovered by this build; the panel drawn in a theme of
its own inside a real Codex; any machine but this one, and
any scaling but 150 per cent.

## v0.6.6-beta — The build announced as v0.6.6, before the panel had a theme of its own

**A pre-release, kept on [its own page](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases/tag/v0.6.6-beta).** Built from `b17076d`, published and
announced as `v0.6.6` on 2026-09-20 and renamed `v0.6.6-beta` on 2026-09-21. It went out without the panel's own
theme, which was asked for the same day, so v0.6.6 was cut a third time. Its notes are v0.6.6's
above less *The panel in Codex has a theme of its own*: the ordinary breath, the taskbar button that
moves where it is installed, the product's own scroll bars and dialog, and the pictures cut to the
window. Its evidence was measured on its own tree: 2,572 tests, and a window built twice to
`c572844e…`, 387,072 bytes.

- It was announced, so it is said plainly: **the tag `v0.6.6` has named three archives**, and this
  was the first announced under it. Its digest is
  `e620280bd5b40ad354d767fe22dd65ec8ed3eefe6b2f0af20d20759fca7e81a3`; `scripts/release.json` pins v0.6.6's, so a copy taken from the beta's page fails the
  comparison, which is the comparison doing its job.
- Nothing is served it: the update check reads the tag out of the URL `releases/latest` ends at and
  accepts `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` alone. A machine running it keeps it and is not moved back to v0.6.5.
  Because the number is the same, the update check does not offer it v0.6.6 either: the v0.6.6
  archive's `Install.cmd` installs over it, and so does the setup script given `-Force`.

## v0.6.6-alpha — The first candidate, set aside before it was announced

**A pre-release, kept on [its own page](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases/tag/v0.6.6-alpha).** Built from `f63d904`, tagged
`v0.6.6` and published on 2026-09-20, then stopped before it was announced: its gentler light - a
smaller swing - was too faint to see, and the scroll bars, the dialog and the pictures' edges had not
been made the product's own yet. It carried two things: a slower, shallower status light (a 4.4 s
cycle, the dot dimming 38% of the way rather than 60%, the glow peaking at 0.30), and the taskbar
button that moves where it is installed, which v0.6.6 carries too.

- Its archive is called `CodexAutoResume-v0.6.6-win-x64.zip` as well, and its digest is
  `3b99217b084148111d07cfc51c9ad8f5bddb6fd50029979ed1b1b6796be0b956`. Nothing is served it, for the same reason as the beta.

## v0.6.5 — A light you can see, notifications in the product's own card, and a Codex Compatibility Registry

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.4...v0.6.5)

A design and safety release. With the compatibility data this release ships, recovery decides
what it decided in v0.6.4: the same classifier, the same gates, the same one watcher that is the
only thing allowed to send. The one difference is a check: codex-cli 0.153.4, which v0.6.4 trusted
by its version, now has to show that `codex queue` still takes a conversation and a message, as
every other build always had to (below). What changed is how much of it you can see - a status light and an
icon that visibly move, notifications drawn in the product's own design, controls that answer as
they change - and a Codex Compatibility Registry, whose data can only ever make the watcher more
careful. The one new setting, **Show notifications as a card beside the notification area**, is on
by default and changes where a notification appears, never whether there is one or what it says.

### The status light

- v0.6.4's light was too quiet to be seen. It now blinks the way the notification-area icon's head
  does: while the watcher is watching, every 3.2 s the dot itself dims to 60% of the way toward the
  card it sits on and comes back, with nothing spreading, and only once it is fully lit does a small
  glow spread from its edge - opacity 0.34, 3 px past the dot at most - and draw back in. A first cut
  breathed a glow reaching 7 px round a dot that never changed; this one was chosen after it, from
  previews at 2, 3 and 4 px. While a recovery is being sent the same cycle runs every 2 s.
- Waiting and checking hold lit with no glow, and a problem runs the cycle once, over 1.4 s, then
  holds lit. The colours, the words beside the light and its size are unchanged, and it is the same
  light in the Dashboard, the popup and the panel; the notification card shows it lit and still.
- Reduce motion and Windows' animation setting hold it lit and still with no glow, and High Contrast
  still draws a solid dot with no glow.

### The notification-area icon moves

- While the watcher is watching, the bright head of the mark breathes on the status light's 3.2 s
  rhythm - dimming toward the badge's deep blue and back - three times, and then sweeps along the
  ring's white stroke and back in a slot of two more breaths, at full brightness: 2.56 s out,
  a moment at the stroke's far end, 2.56 s back, and 1.12 s at home - a loop of five 3.2 s slots,
  16 s in all. It leaves its place clockwise and stays on the stroke, never crossing the gap at the
  top of the ring. It never breathes while it travels, and a breath and the sweep's slot both begin
  and end at full brightness, so nothing jumps where one gives way to the other.
- While a recovery is in progress - a continuation being sent, or the turn it started still being
  followed - the head sweeps out and back over and over, twice as quickly: 1.28 s out, a moment at
  the far end, 1.28 s back and 0.24 s at home, a sweep every 2.88 s, at full brightness and without
  breathing.
- Paused, the head is grey and still. When something needs you it turns amber - the danger colour
  for a failure - pulses once and holds.
- The head moves in 24 steps of 15 degrees round the ring - the 20 of them from its own place
  clockwise to the stroke's far end - and breathes through 24 levels of brightness, a tint of the
  head rather than stored frames: about 16 frames a second while it travels, one for each step of
  watching's sweep, and about 6 while it breathes. Each frame costs explorer.exe the work of drawing
  the icon again, so the rates were chosen by measuring that - each candidate for 60 s against 60 s at
  rest, on one machine (Windows 11 build 26200, 3840 x 2160 at 150%). While it watches, the
  notification-area icon - measured where Windows had put it, in the overflow area - costs
  explorer.exe about 1.3 points of one core above rest at these rates, against 1.1 at the 3 and 5
  frames a second it had before and 2.2 with a breath of 11 a second; the taskbar button costs about
  2 at every rate tried, and was seen redrawn no more than about eight times a second whatever it
  was sent. Travelling all the time, while a recovery is in progress, each costs about 2.5 to 3.
  These were measured while watching turned a whole way round in the last slot of five; it now
  travels in two of them, so what watching costs sits a little nearer the travelling figure.
- It holds still under Reduce motion, Windows' animation setting, High Contrast and battery saver,
  while the session is locked, and while the icon sits in the overflow area where nobody sees it.
  Where the icon is cannot be asked of the shell: Windows 11 build 26200 gives an icon in the
  overflow area the overflow button's own place rather than none, and the icon moved there unseen,
  at explorer.exe's cost. What Windows itself wrote about this icon says it instead - its own
  per-icon setting, read and never written - and an icon it says nothing about is left to the
  shell's answer, as before. At rest it is exactly the icon it has always been; the badge and the
  shape are unchanged.
- While the settings window is open, its taskbar button moves the same way, with the same rhythms
  and frames. Its state is the icon's for the same watcher, as the icon has it while the popup is
  open: the window, like the popup, reads the watcher as it is now. It holds still under the same
  settings, while the session is locked or disconnected - which it asks Windows once a second, where
  the icon hears Windows say it - and while the window is hidden. The title bar's icon does not move, and at
  rest the button is the icon it has always been.

### Notifications in the product's own card

- A notification now appears as a card in the product's own design beside the notification area:
  the popup's card, with the product's name, a status light and, for a detected interruption, the
  kind of interruption on a chip. It says exactly what the Windows notification says - the same
  three lines, in the Interface language - and offers exactly its buttons: **Don't resume** and
  **Open Dashboard** for a detected interruption, none for anything else. A button does what the
  notification's button does, and nothing more: it cancels that one recovery or opens that one page.
- The card rises out of the corner the notification area is in, fading in and growing from 98% to
  full size in about a third of a second, and never takes the keyboard focus. It stays at least 6
  seconds - longer if Windows is set to keep notifications longer - and while the pointer is over
  it, then fades. Up to three stack, the newest nearest the corner, and a newer card about the same
  conversation replaces the older one. Under Reduce motion, Windows' animation setting, battery
  saver or High Contrast it appears and disappears in place.
- Once the card has been on screen, the same Windows notification is added to Windows'
  notification center silently, with no banner and no sound, so the history is what it always was.
  If a card cannot be drawn, Windows' own notification is raised instead.
- Windows' own notification, exactly as before, is used whenever a card must not show: the setting
  is off; the notification-area icon is off; Do not disturb or Focus is on; an app is full screen or
  presenting; the session is locked or remote; a screen reader is running, because Windows'
  notification is announced and a card that never takes the focus is not; or Codex Auto Resume's
  notifications are switched off in Windows' Settings, in which case Windows shows nothing, as it
  always did.
- The setting is under Settings > General > Windows in the Dashboard, beside the notification-area
  icon, with a line saying what it does. Codex cannot change it.
- Which events notify and their wording did not change: the **Notifications** switch and the event
  check boxes still decide whether there is a notification at all.

### Depth in the popup

- What stands on the popup's card is now raised and what holds a value is sunken: each waiting
  task is a tile lifted off the card - a soft drop and highlight in light; in dark, a faint drop and
  a one-pixel light along its top edge on a slightly brighter ground - the three counts sit in one
  sunken well with a hairline between them, "nothing waiting" and a failed read are said from a well
  too, and a button sinks into a well while it is pressed. High Contrast draws none of it.
- In the panel in Codex, each waiting conversation's row and the Automatic recovery switch's tile
  are lifted the same way.
- The Dashboard's Pending and History lists stay flat rows with a hairline between them, as in
  v0.6.4.
- A count's label is never cut inside a word: a column whose longest word needs more room gets it.

### The window's first screen

- The Overview's **Pause recovery** or **Resume recovery**, **Pending** and **History** are back at
  the bottom left of their cards, in a row of their own under what the card says, as in v0.6.2. The
  header's **Start watcher** and the Custom messages' **Clear** buttons stay at the bottom right.
- The window opens at 1000 × 664 instead of 1000 × 632. The Overview's rows are as tall as their
  cards need and a little more, never more than 24 px past it, with the page's own 14 px gap under
  the last row rather than cards stretched to the footer. On a screen whose work area is shorter -
  1920 × 1080 at 150% with the taskbar, for one - it opens as tall as the work area, and the
  Overview still fits there in every language.

### Lists, drop-down lists and switches

- Lists in the window no longer overflow sideways at ordinary sizes. As a list narrows, a
  conversation's name gives way first, then what a column holds past a readable width, then
  headings wider than what they head, the widest first, and last the cells, the widest first; what
  no longer fits ends in an ellipsis, so a time or a count stays whole while a long name or state is
  shortened. Only a list narrower than its columns can shrink to scrolls sideways, on the window's
  own soft bar; Windows' white horizontal bar no longer shows.
- Drop-down lists are drawn by the product, in the window and in the panel: a card of the cards'
  own material floating under the field with the soft shadow, its items pills - the chosen one
  sunken, the one under the pointer raised, the one the keyboard is on ringed. It opens where there
  is room, shows up to twelve rows and scrolls the rest, rises into place unless motion is reduced,
  and is drawn in system colours with no shadow in High Contrast. The keys are Windows': it opens on
  a click, F4, Alt+Up, Alt+Down or Space, the arrows, Home, End, Page Up and Page Down move, typing
  finds the next item that starts with what was typed, Enter or Tab takes an item and Escape closes
  it unchanged. A screen reader hears it as a combo box with its choice and the item the keyboard is
  on. In dark the open list is dark: v0.6.4 left it in Windows' light frame.
- Switches glide when they change - the knob slides and the track cross-fades in 160 ms, on one
  ease-out curve - in the window, the popup and the panel, and check boxes fade in the window and
  the panel. A switch whose change has to be confirmed first - by you, or by the watcher - moves once,
  when it is confirmed, and never slides and snaps back. Nothing moves under Reduce motion, Windows'
  animation setting or High Contrast.

### Words

- The panel in Codex keeps Korean words whole when it wraps a line, and Japanese phrases; the
  window breaks Korean lines only at spaces, where Windows used to break them inside a word.
- The popup and the notification card set Latin text in Windows' UI font, as the window and the
  panel do.
- Everything new is in all nine languages.

### Codex Compatibility Registry

- For the Codex engine on this machine, the product now says which of the things it does can be
  relied on, in four words: **verified** - the maintainer tested this exact Codex version, with
  recorded evidence; **compatible** - the checks on this computer pass, and nobody has verified this
  exact version; **incompatible** - a check on this computer failed, or the compatibility data says
  this version does not work; **unknown** - it could not be established, because a check could not
  run. It is on a new **Codex compatibility** card on the Diagnostics page, read-only in a card in
  the panel, in `status` and `doctor`, in a new `compat` command, and in the diagnostics export.
- The watcher does the checking as it runs: the checks the engine it drives has already passed,
  the column names of Codex's databases (never a row), the folders recovery reads and the Windows
  interface that tells whether a conversation is open. It writes what it found to
  `config\compatibility.json`. Everything that shows it checks the file again as it reads it, and
  shows unknown, saying why, for one that is damaged, too old, or about a Codex binary that has
  since changed.
- The data ships inside the release. The data this release ships marks no capability verified: a
  verified entry has to cite a recording made on that exact Codex version, and none of the
  repository's recordings says which version it was made on yet. So every capability is decided by
  the checks on this computer - compatible where they pass - which is what the product did before
  the registry existed. Its one restriction, for codex-cli 0.153.4, is on recovering a conversation
  that is not open in the app, which this product does not do.
- The one build v0.6.4 called verified, codex-cli 0.153.4, is now shown as compatible, and like
  every other build it has to show that `codex queue` still offers `--thread` and `--message` before
  anything is sent to it; v0.6.4 skipped that check for it.
- The data is refreshed only when you ask: **Refresh compatibility data** on the Diagnostics card,
  or **Check for updates** once github.com has answered it, whether or not an update exists. The
  update check skips the refresh when github.com could not be reached and when too little of its
  time is left, and its answer about updates is the same either way. Nothing polls, the watcher
  never asks, and neither the panel nor Codex can ask. A refresh is one HTTPS GET to one fixed
  address on raw.githubusercontent.com - this repository's own data file on its main branch - with
  no query string and nothing about this machine in it.
- What arrives is handed to this installation's own validator, which keeps it, as
  `config\compat-cache.json`, only if it is compatibility data this version can read and no older
  than what is in force; anything else is refused, and a refresh that fails or is refused changes
  nothing. The card says what happened: refreshed with the data's number, refused and why, could
  not be fetched, or busy while an installation or a repair is running.
- Refreshed data can only make the watcher more careful. It can mark a Codex version incompatible,
  and then nothing is sent while it is in force. It can mark something verified only for an exact
  version whose checks on this computer already pass, which changes the word and not what is sent.
  A check that fails on this computer always wins. Refreshed data past its expiry, about 90 days,
  keeps its restrictions and loses its verifications.
- Codex sees a summary: `get_status`, and `open_settings` with it, now carries the compatibility
  summary as codes only - the overall result and the one the watcher acts on, whether the report
  could be used, which data is in force and its number, the refreshed data's standing, when it was
  checked, and each capability's state and reason. No version string, no path, no free text. No
  tool can refresh or import the data.

### Fixed

- **`"enabled": "false"` turned automatic recovery on.** The window's bridge read its switches'
  value with a plain truth test, so any non-empty text counted as yes: a request carrying `"false"`
  switched recovery on and, for Run at Windows sign-in, wrote this product's sign-in autostart value;
  a request with no value switched them off. The settings window always sends a real true or false,
  so its own switches were not affected. Anything else is now refused, with the message and code
  the control layer gives.
- **Settings accepted or refused a value of the wrong type depending on the default.** An update
  was compared with what it coerced to, so `{"notifications": 1}` was accepted and
  `{"notifications": 0}` refused, and `{"reduce_motion": 0}` was accepted. A value is now checked
  for the type the settings schema publishes first and refused if it is the wrong one, whatever it
  equals. A settings file with such a value is still read as the default rather than refused.
- **The log left out the reason for 14 of the 27 states a recovery can be in**, every outcome of a
  recovery turn among them, and wrote the bare state name. Every state line now carries its reason
  code, and still codes only.
- **The release job did not check three things every installed copy requires of an update**:
  `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, `scripts/plugin_setup.py` and the icon at the payload's root. An
  archive missing one would have been published and then refused by every installed copy. It checks
  all ten entries now, and tests hold its list to what the bootstrap requires in both directions.
- **A damaged plugin manifest passed as version "unknown", with nothing said.** The installation's
  root is now found by its manifest rather than by counting folders, and a manifest that is there
  but cannot be read logs a warning saying why, once, before the version reads unknown. A missing
  manifest still reads unknown quietly.

### Groundwork for splitting the Python code

Nothing a user sees. Every safety scan in the tests now reads the whole package, recursively, so
moving code into a subpackage can never take it out of a check's sight; the package's layers, each
module's size and its structural invariants are held by tests; and the screenshot checks are keyed
on what the window is shown rather than on which files changed. The split itself, and the golden
replies, gathered rules and typed contracts that come before it, are v0.6.7.

### Documents

- `PRIVACY.md` and `SECURITY.md` describe the compatibility refresh - when it happens, its one
  address, what is and is not sent, which file holds what and who writes it - the summary
  `get_status` carries, and the notification card. The feature matrix, the brand document and the
  roadmap describe the rest.
- The README pictures a notification as the card it now is, in the light and the dark theme, in
  place of a capture of Windows' notification taken before Open Dashboard existed, which no
  manifest pinned. The card's pictures are drawn off-screen by the card's own code and pinned as
  the popup's are, so a change to what the card says or how it is drawn fails the suite until they
  are made again. The old capture is gone.

### Evidence

Everything below was run on the release candidate built from this tree, on one Windows 11 machine
(Home, build 26200, 3840 x 2160 at 150%, Korean system language, Windows' apps set to dark and the
product's Theme set to Light).

- **The suite.** 2,555 tests, no failures, under Python 3.13 (966 s, 8 skipped) and 3.12 (952 s, 7
  skipped) here, and green on GitHub's Windows runners for 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 and 3.15. The skips are
  the opt-in live checks, the pin check that waits for the tag, and, on one interpreter here, the
  workflow parser that wants PyYAML.
- **The window, built twice.** Two builds of `CodexAutoResumeSettings.exe` from these sources are
  byte-identical (`e634e921…`, 382,976 bytes), and `build/normalize_pe.py` accepts both.
- **Clipping.** The layout audit builds the window hidden in all nine languages at 100, 125, 150,
  175 and 200 per cent, in every watcher state, and reports anything cut off, any pinned button away
  from its corner, any text under one, and an Overview that scrolls. It reports nothing.
- **Installed over v0.6.4 on this machine.** The installer answered *Updated. Your settings and
  pending recoveries were kept.*; `config\settings.json` held every value it had before, byte for
  byte on the first install and with only this release's new setting added afterwards; the watcher
  restarted and the plugin manifest read 0.6.5. The installed MCP server introduced itself as 0.6.5
  with its seventeen tools, previewed a continuation in Korean, still refused to let
  `update_settings` write a Custom message, and carried the compatibility summary as codes only,
  with no tool that could refresh or import data.
- **The compatibility card and its refresh, for real.** The watcher checked the Codex on this
  machine - `codex-cli 0.155.0-alpha.9.2` - found every local check passing and the bundled data
  verifying nothing, called it compatible and wrote `config\compatibility.json`. **Refresh
  compatibility data** then fetched the published file: `compatibility: refreshed 1`, written to
  `config\compat-cache.json` by this installation's own validator.
- **Check for updates, and the refresh that rides on it.** With v0.6.5 installed and v0.6.4 the
  newest published release, the check answered `update: newer-local 0.6.5 0.6.4` and still refreshed
  the compatibility data on the way (`compatibility: refreshed 1`) - the refresh happens whether or
  not there is an update, and it never changes the update's own answer.
- **The notification card, on a real desktop.** Three cards stacked in the notification area's
  corner, drawn by the installed build's own code in dark and in light: the product's name, the
  status light, the reason chip, the three lines and the two buttons, with the entrance and the
  stack as designed.
- **The icon's motion.** On this machine the notification-area icon sits in Windows 11's overflow
  flyout, where this release holds it still on purpose: the watcher used 1.1 s of processor time in
  its first 40 minutes. The motion itself - the breath, the clockwise sweep along the mark's stroke
  and back, and the states - was captured from a real taskbar button with the window built into a
  scratch folder, and is held by tests frame for frame against the icon's own table.
- **The status light.** Drawn through a whole cycle on every surface - the window, the popup, the
  panel in Codex and the notification card - in light and dark at 100% and 150%, and compared side
  by side with the design it was approved from; the suite also reads the drawn pixels for the dot's
  dimming and the glow's three-pixel reach.
- **Drop-down lists, switches and a screen reader.** The probes open the real drop-down list, walk
  it with the keys, type to find, close it on an outside click, glide the switches and read the list
  and its highlighted item through Windows' own UI Automation. No screen reader was run.
- **Korean and Latin text.** The window breaks Korean at spaces only (71 strings across four widths
  and three scalings), the panel keeps Korean words whole, and the popup and the card set Latin text
  in Windows' UI font, as the window and the panel do; the Korean pictures show it.

Not verified, and not claimed: High Contrast on a real system (it is rendered and asserted, never
switched on here); a real Codex interruption recovered by this build; the card's fallbacks on a
locked, full-screen or Do Not Disturb desktop, or with a screen reader running (the rule is held by
tests only); the taskbar button's motion in the installed window (the window open on this machine
was opened before the update; the motion was captured from a scratch build instead); any machine but
this one, and any scaling but 150 per cent.

## v0.6.4 — One look in light and dark, a quieter status light, and a window that arrives ready

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.3...v0.6.4)

A design and speed release. Recovery decides exactly what it decided in v0.6.3: the same
classifier, the same gates, the same one watcher that is the only thing allowed to send. The one
new setting, **Theme**, changes how the product looks and nothing it does.

### One design

- The Dashboard and the notification-area popup now use the materials of the panel in Codex:
  the same raised cards and sunken fields, the same soft shadows, corner radii and controls.
  State chips have no border, and buttons stand out and sink when pressed. The text sizes, the
  Dashboard's pages and Settings sections, and the popup's layout - apart from where buttons and
  switches sit, below - are unchanged, and so are the notification-area icon and its badge.
- The Dashboard's header and footer are floating cards, and the page tabs sit on the canvas.
- High Contrast: the popup follows it now too - system colours, no shadows, no motion - and
  the panel has a forced-colors style, so its lights, switch knobs and select arrows no longer
  disappear.

### Light and dark

- A new **Theme** setting, first under Settings > Appearance in the Dashboard and in a new
  Appearance card at the end of the panel: **Use system setting**, the default, **Light** or
  **Dark**. In the Dashboard and the popup, *Use system setting* follows the app mode Windows is
  set to (Settings > Personalization > Colors); in the panel it follows Codex's own theme, as the
  panel always has. **Light** and **Dark** hold on every surface, whatever Windows or Codex use.
- Because the default follows Windows, on a PC whose apps are set to dark the Dashboard and the
  popup are dark after this update. Choose **Light** to keep them as they were.
- Dark is the panel's dark theme, now on all three surfaces: the same palette, cards lifted a
  step off a near-black canvas by a faint drop shadow and a one-pixel light along their top edge,
  and the same wells, switches, check boxes, buttons and scroll bars. The Dashboard's title bar
  goes dark with it, and so does the notification-area icon's right-click menu whenever the popup
  is dark, on Windows 10 version 1903 and later.
- High Contrast wins over any theme, on every surface.
- Some things Windows draws itself stay light in dark: the Dashboard's message boxes - its
  confirmations and reports - the file dialog of **Export diagnostics...**, a text box's
  right-click menu and the frame of an open drop-down list. Windows notifications look as Windows
  draws them, and the notification-area icon and its badge do not change with the theme.
- Codex can change the theme too: `update_settings` accepts `theme`. The notification-area icon and
  Reduce motion are still not offered to Codex.

### Changing the language or the theme

- The Dashboard builds its words and colours when it opens. When a Save changes the Interface
  language or the theme, the window now closes and opens again by itself, in the new language or
  theme, on the same page and Settings section, in the same place and at the same size - maximized
  if it was - with the keyboard where it was. It used to say that the change would show the next
  time it opened.
- It does the same when either is changed somewhere else while it is open - in the panel, through
  Codex, on the command line or in another Dashboard window - when Windows switches its apps
  between light and dark while the theme follows Windows, and when High Contrast is turned on or
  off.
- It never reopens over changes that are not saved. A note in the save card then says the window
  will reopen once you save or discard them, and it reopens as soon as you do. If the new window
  cannot start, the old one stays open and goes on working.
- A Save sends the Interface language and the theme only when they were changed on that page, in
  the Dashboard and in the panel, so saving something else cannot put back a language or a theme
  that was changed elsewhere in the meantime.
- The popup and the right-click menu use a new language or theme the next time they open, without
  a restart of the watcher, and an open popup redraws when Windows switches between light and dark.
- The panel applies a saved language or theme at once, where it is. To speak any of the nine
  languages without asking again, it now carries all of their words, which takes the page Codex is
  served from about 105 KB to about 205 KB.

### Switches and check boxes

- A switch now always turns something that runs on or off: notifications, the notification-area
  icon, Reduce motion, Run at Windows sign-in, and automatic recovery for one conversation. A check
  box picks which items of a list apply: which kinds of interruption are recovered and, under the
  notifications switch, which events notify. A setting is the same kind in the Dashboard and in the
  panel, and a check box sits to the left of its label everywhere.
- The check box is new, in the same material: empty, it is a sunken well; ticked, it is filled
  with the accent and carries a tick; disabled, it is muted; in High Contrast it is drawn in system
  colours.

### Buttons and switches at the bottom right

- A button or an on/off switch at the right of a card or a row is now pinned to its bottom-right
  corner, in the Dashboard, the popup and the panel. What the card or row says comes first, from
  the top left, and the control closes it. Text beside a control wraps, or the control moves under
  the text and stays on the right, so nothing runs underneath it; in the Dashboard and the panel
  the keyboard and screen readers reach the control after the text. Buttons that were already
  along the bottom, drop-downs, chips, check boxes and the Dashboard's switches - before their
  labels in Settings, in their column on Pending - stay where they were.
- In the Dashboard, **Pause recovery** or **Resume recovery**, **Pending** and **History** sit at
  the bottom right of their Overview cards rather than at the left under the cards' content, and
  **Start watcher** sits at the bottom right of the header. **History** stands under the finished
  conversations when their outcomes reach the card's edge.
- **Right now** keeps its order - automatic recovery, the watcher, the Codex engine, the last
  check - with the button that pauses and resumes recovery under them at the card's bottom right.
  The card is laid out for the longest words it can show, so it does not move when the watcher's
  state changes or its last check grows older, and the Overview still fits the window whatever
  state the watcher is in.
- In the popup, each task's switch has moved to the right end of its row, level with the last line
  of its label however far the label wraps, and the label wraps in the room left of it.
- In the panel, the **Pause recovery** or **Resume recovery** button at the top of the Automatic
  recovery card sits at the bottom right of its tile, beside the state and, when a pause fails,
  the message under it. The **Show notifications** switch sits beside the last line of its label,
  and each waiting conversation's **Auto-resume** switch beside the line with its next check and
  attempts. In a narrow panel each moves under its text and stays on the right.

### The status light

- While the watcher is running and recovery is on, the light is cyan again - the colour it had
  before v0.6.3 - whether the watcher is watching, waiting, checking a task or recovering; the
  word beside it says which. It glows softly and breathes slowly.
- A paused or stopped watcher shows the same grey as before, with no glow. A stopped watcher
  is grey again rather than amber; amber is for a running watcher that needs you.
- Reduce motion, Windows' animation setting and High Contrast still hold it still.

### The window

- It opens at 1000 × 632 instead of growing to fit the longest Settings section: as tall as fits
  a 1920 × 1080 screen at 150% with the taskbar, less a few pixels, and a size the Overview fits
  without scrolling in all nine languages at scalings from 100% to 200%. A Settings section taller
  than the window scrolls. On a screen with less room, it opens no larger than the screen's work
  area.
- The Overview's four cards share the height of the page: its two rows reach from under the tabs
  to just above the footer, both rows are the same height and so are the cards in each, so the
  cards are taller and no empty band is left above the footer. What a card says stays at its top,
  and a card's button moves down with its bottom-right corner. In a window too short for rows of
  one height, each row keeps what its own cards need, and the Overview scrolls only when they need
  more than the window has.
- On Pending, **Why it is waiting** is as tall as the list beside it and scrolls inside its own
  card, so the page does not.
- Pages, Settings sections and lists scroll on a soft bar made of the same material instead of
  Windows' own scroll bar. It shows only while there is more than fits, darkens a step under the
  pointer, glides unless motion is reduced, brings a control the keyboard moves to into view, and
  is drawn in system colours in High Contrast.
- It waits until it has a page to show, and it gets there sooner. Measured at 150% scaling on an
  empty installation during development, inside the window: the first painted header went from
  1.46-1.54 s to 0.44-0.45 s, later page switches from a median of about 100 ms (at most 203 ms)
  to 22 ms (at most 59 ms), the Continuation message section from 222-241 ms to 74-82 ms, and the
  bridge's status check from 341 ms to 168 ms. Measured from outside on a real installation with
  real history, the window is on screen about 0.3 s later than v0.6.3's empty frame was - and
  holds a page people can use about 3 s sooner. The Evidence section gives the numbers.
- To get there, pages and Settings sections are built when they are first shown, a page that
  was refreshed in the last two seconds is not asked again, and the window keeps its interface
  text in `config\strings-cache.json`, beside the settings. That file is used only when the product version,
  the stored interface language and the Windows language all still match; otherwise the window
  asks, as it always did, before it shows a word.
- The bridge's status check no longer loads the watcher to find out whether one is running.

### Fixed

- **Combo boxes lost their bottom edge.** Continuation language, Preview for, Use the message
  for, Message for, Retry timing and the Statistics period were drawn with the bottom border
  cut off. A settings row measured its height before the window's font reached it, and the box
  grew afterwards. Rows now measure again when the box or the font changes, and a test builds
  the window at five scalings in all nine languages and reports anything cut off.
- In the panel, a primary button pressed from the keyboard showed white text on a light
  field, and disabled controls used half-transparent text; they now use readable muted text.

### Documents

- A roadmap, `docs/ROADMAP.md` and its Korean translation, says where the project is heading
  release by release: a direction, not a promise.

### Evidence

Everything below was run on the release candidate built from this tree, on one Windows 11 machine
(24H2 build 26200, 3840 x 2160 at 150%, Korean system language, dark app mode).

- **The suite.** 1,820 tests, no failures, under Python 3.13 (710 s, 8 skipped) and 3.12 (715 s,
  7 skipped) here, and green on GitHub's Windows runners for 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 and 3.15. The skips
  are the six opt-in live checks, the pin check that waits for the tag, and, on 3.13 here, the
  workflow parser that wants PyYAML.
- **The window, built twice.** Two builds of `CodexAutoResumeSettings.exe` from the same sources are
  byte-identical, and `build/normalize_pe.py` accepts both.
- **Clipping.** The layout audit builds the window hidden in all nine languages at 100, 125, 150,
  175 and 200 per cent, in every watcher state, and reports anything cut off, any pinned button away
  from its corner, any text under one, and an Overview that scrolls. It reports nothing.
- **Installed over v0.6.3 on this machine.** The installer answered *Updated. Your settings and
  pending recoveries were kept.*; `config\settings.json` was byte-identical afterwards, the watcher
  kept running, and the plugin manifest read 0.6.4. The installed MCP server introduced itself as
  0.6.4 with its seventeen tools, previewed a continuation in Korean, and still refused to let
  `update_settings` write a Custom message.
- **A theme change, on the real window.** Settings > Appearance > Theme from *Use system setting* to
  *Light*, then Save: the window closed and came back by itself in light, on the same page, at the
  same size and place. Setting it back returned it to dark.
- **The popup, from a real click.** Clicking the notification-area icon opened the popup in dark:
  the state line, the three counts, the empty-state note and its two buttons, 564 x 438 device px.
- **First-window timing, from outside.** Process start until the window is on screen, then until it
  has drawn its page, no input sent, warm, on a copy of a real installation: v0.6.3 830-1035 ms and
  5.1-7.6 s; v0.6.4 1.2-1.3 s and 1.8-2.0 s. Inside v0.6.4 the largest costs are the process's first
  font (215 ms on this machine's 610 font files), building and laying out the Overview (600 ms) and
  Windows showing the finished window (333 ms).

Not verified, and not claimed: High Contrast on a real system (it is rendered and asserted, never
switched on here), a real Codex interruption recovered by this build, any machine but this one, and
any scaling but 150 per cent.

## v0.6.3 — Nine languages, your own words, and a window that shows it is alive

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.2...v0.6.3)

A feature and design release. Recovery itself decides exactly what it decided in v0.6.2:
the same classifier, the same gates, the same one watcher that is the only thing allowed to
send. What changed is what it says, in which language, and how much of what it is doing
you can see.

### Languages

- **Nine interface languages**: English, 한국어, 日本語, 简体中文, 繁體中文, Español, Deutsch,
  Français and Português (Brasil). The Dashboard, the notification-area popup and menu,
  Windows notifications and the panel in Codex all speak the same one.
- **Interface language setting** (Settings > General). The default, *System*, follows the
  first language Windows lists, as before; a language this product does not ship is English.
  An explicit choice wins over Windows and survives restarts, repairs and updates.
  `CODEX_AUTO_RESUME_LANG` still replaces what Windows reports, so it decides the language
  only while the setting is *System*.
- Catalogs are plain JSON, one per language, with English as the source and the fallback
  for any key a translation has not reached. Nothing is fetched from the network. The
  translations are tracked against the English they were made from, so a sentence changed
  in English shows up as stale in every language until it is looked at again.

### The continuation message

- **Continuation language** (default: the interface language) and **Message style**:
  *Minimal* only asks Codex to retry; *Standard* (the default) says why the task stopped;
  *Detailed* also asks Codex to check the work so far and not repeat what is done.
- **Custom** sends your own words, exactly as typed - one message for every interruption,
  or one per kind of interruption, falling back to the message for every interruption and
  then to Standard. It may use `{reason}`, `{category}`, `{attempt}`, `{max_attempts}` and
  `{reset_time}` and nothing else; a placeholder that would put your prompt, the reply, a
  title, a path, an account or a token into the message is refused by name. At most 2000
  characters. Nothing about the text can make a failure recoverable, skip a check, or
  choose a different conversation. A placeholder with no value for that interruption is
  left out, closing only the gap it leaves; a message left with nothing to say falls back
  as if it were empty, rather than sending Codex a turn with nothing in it. `{attempt}` and
  `{max_attempts}` count what the attempt budget counts, and a usage limit, which spends no
  attempts, has neither.
- **Preview** shows the exact text that would be sent, built by the same function the
  watcher sends with, for each kind of interruption and for choices not yet saved.
- Custom text is written only in the Windows Dashboard. It cannot be set from Codex - not
  through `update_settings` and not through the new read-only `preview_recovery_message`
  tool - because text sent automatically into your conversations must not be something a
  model can be talked into changing. It can be *read* there: the panel shows it, and
  `get_status` and `open_settings` return it with the other settings, so whatever it says
  becomes part of that conversation. A diagnostics export records only whether each
  Custom message is set, never its text.
- **Changed default:** the continuation used to be one fixed English sentence per kind of
  interruption. It is now the Standard message in the continuation language, which on an
  English system reads almost the same.

### The Dashboard

- A new visual language shared with the popup and the panel: soft raised cards, rounded
  controls, state words on tinted chips, a keyboard focus ring, and no colour without a
  word beside it. High Contrast mode drops shadows and tints and uses system colours.
  Light theme; the panel in Codex follows Codex's own theme.
- The header's status dot shows what the watcher is doing - monitoring (a slow breath),
  waiting, checking a task that has come due, recovering, paused, or needing you (one
  pulse). **Reduce motion** (Settings > Appearance) stops every animation, and Windows'
  own animation setting is always honoured.
- **Settings** is split into General, Automatic recovery, Continuation message, Appearance
  and Advanced.
- **Pending** gains an **Auto-resume** check box for each task, bound to that task's exact
  interruption and conversation. A click that reaches a record which has since finished,
  disappeared or turned out to belong to another conversation is refused and changes
  nothing. It changes policy only; the watcher still decides, and still sends.
- **Why it is waiting** lists the watcher's safety checks for the chosen task as it last
  recorded them.
- **Cancel all** stops every pending recovery, one exact record at a time. There is
  deliberately no "retry all".

### Notifications

- A transient interruption's notification names the kind of interruption.
- Both interruption notifications gain **Open Dashboard**, which opens the Pending page and
  can do nothing else.

### Fixed

- **A recoverable kind of interruption had no switch.** `auth_service_transient` (a
  sign-in service that is temporarily unavailable) became recoverable after the settings'
  list of switchable categories was last changed, so it was recovered with no way to turn
  it off and no name in any window. It now has a switch, on by default, and a test holds
  the classifier and the list of switches to each other in both directions.

### Python

- CI now runs every non-live test on Python 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14 as blocking jobs, and on
  the 3.15 pre-release as an advisory job whose result is shown but does not block. 3.11
  and older are not supported. The release still bundles Python 3.13.15, so installing it
  needs no Python at all.

### Evidence

What was run for this release, and what was not. Unless it says otherwise, everything below
was run on the code this tag was made from, with one exception: three `switch` statements in
the window's code were rewritten as plain comparisons, with no change in behaviour, after the
local test runs and the Windows checks below (see the first release run, below); CI ran the
whole suite again on the tagged commit. The other later commits changed only documents - this
section and the feature matrix's record of the run - and one test, so that it reads the
Korean documents where the generated `ko` branch keeps them.

- **The first release run stopped itself.** Tagging this version started a release run that
  builds the settings window twice and compares the two, and they differed, so nothing was
  published. The in-box C# compiler names one class with a fresh random GUID when a string
  `switch` has six or more cases, and three written for this release did. They are now plain
  comparisons. `build/normalize_pe.py` refuses an executable that still holds such a class, so
  the build fails on the machine that made it rather than in a release run, and a test compiles
  a program with one and checks the refusal. The tag was then placed on the fixed commit;
  nothing had been published under it.

- **Tests.** The whole non-live suite passed on Windows 11 under Python 3.12 and 3.13
  (1,508 tests each), and in CI on 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14 as blocking jobs; the advisory 3.15
  pre-release job passed too. The icon test used to compare compressed bytes and failed on
  3.14 and 3.15 with identical pixels, because those Pythons deflate with a different zlib;
  it now compares what each icon decodes to.
- **A pre-release review.** Every change in this release was reviewed adversarially by
  area, and each finding was checked by a second reviewer who tried to refute it. Eighteen
  findings; one was refuted, and the other seventeen - fourteen distinct - are fixed here,
  each with a test. The ones that could change what is sent or what a switch does:
  - Custom text made only of placeholders - `{reset_time}` for an interruption with no
    reset time - was sent as a turn holding nothing but the marker, and spent an attempt.
  - A right-click on a task's Auto-resume box switched automatic recovery off for that
    conversation.
  - Holding Space or Enter on a switch in the notification-area popup flipped it back and
    forth, and where it stopped was chance.
  - A closed popup kept the icon's badge on "needs attention" after the problem cleared.
  - The one-shot bridge put Custom message text on a `python.exe` command line.

  The rest were wording and display defects: `{attempt}` counting claims rather than
  attempts, filling a placeholder reflowing the whole message, High Contrast text drawn on
  a Highlight fill, an alarm that pulsed again every refresh, a halo that stayed frozen
  after a restore, a card that measured its text wider than it drew it, a counter that
  counted emoji twice, the diagnostics export recording the wrong language, and the
  translation export's own output refused by its import. Reviewing the fixes found one
  more: the long-lived bridge refused a valid Save of long Custom messages as too large.
- **On a real Windows 11 machine** (150% scaling). A release candidate built from this code
  passed `build/smoke_archive.py` and was installed over an earlier candidate: the installer
  reported the update and did not rewrite the settings file, the installed files matched the
  archive, the installed MCP server reported 0.6.3 and 17 tools, `preview_recovery_message`
  returned the Standard message in Korean, and `update_settings` refused `custom_message`.
  The upgrade from v0.6.2 was performed with that earlier candidate, built before the review
  fixes: it kept the settings file byte for byte and every pending and history record, and
  its Dashboard showed the preserved history in Korean.
- **The popup, by hand**, on the earlier candidate. A person clicked the notification-area
  icon and the popup opened. With their permission Claude then drove the mouse and keyboard:
  a click opened it, Open Dashboard opened the Pending page and closed it, and a click
  elsewhere closed it. In a copy of the popup running against a stand-in control layer, real
  Tab, Shift+Tab and Space presses moved the focus ring and switched the focused button.
  Escape could not be pressed for real: while Claude's computer control was active, another
  process held plain Escape as a global hotkey, so no window received its key-down. The
  popup's Escape handling is covered by a test that delivers the key to the real window.
- **Not verified.** The popup was not driven by hand again on the final candidate. The High
  Contrast, right-click and minimize-and-restore fixes were not seen in a running window;
  they are covered by the build, by tests that run the window's own code, and by checks on
  its source. No Windows notification with Open Dashboard was raised, because no real
  interruption happened and none was made up. No Codex conversation was continued with the
  new messages, and the panel was not opened inside Codex. No real Codex visual recovery is
  claimed. The screenshots are rendered from sample data, not from anyone's conversations.

## v0.6.2 — The update could not check what it had downloaded

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.1...v0.6.2)

One fix, in the step that decides whether anything gets installed.

- **Fixed: the Dashboard's update downloaded the archive and then could not verify it.**
  The verification step used `Get-FileHash`, and on a real machine that cmdlet did not
  resolve in the process the update button starts, so the run ended with "'Get-FileHash'
  is not recognized as a cmdlet" and installed nothing. Refusing to install something it
  could not verify was right; naming a cmdlet as the reason was not, and the feature was
  unusable either way. The digest is now computed with the SHA-256 in the runtime
  PowerShell is already hosted in, so there is nothing left to autoload. `make_gui.ps1`
  had already moved off that cmdlet after meeting the same thing under the release
  runner's module path; the shipped script had not, and this is the second time it has
  cost something. Tests lift the function out of the shipped script and run it with
  `Get-FileHash` removed from the session.

  This does not repair an installation that already has the old script: the copy doing the
  updating is the one with the defect. Reaching a build with the fix means installing it
  the ordinary way rather than through the button.

## v0.6.1 — What running it for real found

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.6.0...v0.6.1)

Every change here came from the first live acceptance of v0.6.0: installing the published
archive on a machine somebody uses and watching it work. The published v0.6.0 archive and
tag are untouched - a correction gets a new version, which is what this is.

- **Fixed: a recovery that worked was recorded as a failure.** The engine read the status
  Codex puts on the recovery turn and nothing else. But the commonest way a recovery turn
  ends is the *next* usage limit, and Codex records the turn a limit interrupted as
  `failed` - so a continuation that was delivered, ran, and carried the task forward was
  filed as `recovery_failed`. Three real recoveries in a row, two of them recorded as
  failures, in the History, the statistics and the success rate. The outcome now asks the
  question the completed branch already asked - did this turn do anything? - and a turn
  that made progress is `recovered` whatever ended it. The raw status stays on the record
  and in the journal, so nothing is lost by calling the recovery what it was. Recovery
  itself was never affected: the chain continued correctly throughout, which is why only
  the reporting was wrong, and why the numbers a person reads were the part that lied.
- Require current, readable Codex projection data before a new continuation; never use
  an older database after a newer unsupported generation appears.
- Recheck pause, cancellation and conversation consent under the state write lock through
  queue-process launch. Release that lock before waiting for a receipt.
- Count repeated claims of one interruption toward the daily cap. Schema 3 retains only
  the latest claim timestamp, so the count deliberately errs toward waiting longer.
- Refuse unreadable or malformed installation journals before restoring or sweeping files.
  Keep an uninstall retryable after plugin removal fails or a root program file is locked.
- Reject malformed MCP envelopes and arguments before invoking controls. Do not show a
  successful save or pause change after a refused call; preserve acknowledged settings.
- Show the Dashboard's budget-reset explanation when the conversation is still disabled.
- Correct release wording, approval-hint claims and the English/Korean live procedure.

Live acceptance is incomplete, and the evidence for v0.6.0 does not carry over: evidence
belongs to one build, so the records that described v0.6.0 are kept as history under
`docs/evidence/live-0.6.0/` rather than inherited by this one. Of the fifteen steps there,
one passed and fourteen were blocked, because no genuine interruption was exercised in the
disposable acceptance conversation and no failure was fabricated to make one. The defect at
the top of this list was found outside that procedure, in ordinary use, which is its own
argument for running the procedure. No real Codex visual recovery is claimed.

## v0.6.0 — It follows its own turn, and it shows you the work

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.5.7...v0.6.0)

Two changes, and most of the rest follows from them. The engine no longer reads the
conversation for signs that a recovery worked: it follows the continuation it sent to the
exact Codex turn that continuation started, and reads the outcome from that turn alone. And
the window from the Start Menu, which was a settings page, now shows what the watcher has
seen and done — Overview, Pending, History, Statistics and Diagnostics, beside the settings
that were already there.

In short, and each of these has its own section below:

- **It follows its own turn.** A turn you started yourself can no longer be read as the
  recovery working, and an outcome that could not be established is called unverified
  rather than a success.
- **A Dashboard, not a settings page.** Six pages, and every one of them is now captured
  from the real window in both languages.
- **An icon in the notification area**, owned by the watcher itself, with a live countdown
  to the next check — and a route from its menu to the exact work that is waiting.
- **Safety gates and a timeline.** Why a recovery is waiting, in the same 22 public words
  everywhere, over a content-free journal that nothing reads back to decide anything.
- **History, statistics and a redacted diagnostics export**, none of which can carry a
  prompt, a reply, a path or an account.
- **It can tell you a new version exists** — when you ask it, never on its own — and
  install one through the same checksum-verified installer, keeping your pause, your
  per-conversation decisions and everything waiting.
- **Installing and repairing are harder to break**: a crash journal, a payload root copied
  by name, an upgrade that repairs without deciding anything, and a watcher handover that
  is checked rather than assumed.
- **The supply chain is checkable**: every Action pinned to a commit, the build split from
  the publish, reproducible executables, and a feature matrix that says for every capability
  what evidence it has actually earned.

The state file moves to schema 3 the first time the new watcher opens it. The last section
says what works in between.

### Recovery follows the continuation it sent

- **Fixed: a turn you started yourself could be read as the recovery working.** The engine
  called a recovery delivered once its message appeared anywhere in the conversation, and
  judged progress from any later turn — which can be a turn you started yourself. Each
  continuation carries a marker built from the interruption's own id; the turn it started is
  the turn of the history row that holds that marker, and a unique index in the state file
  makes it impossible for two records to own one Codex turn. The outcome is read from that
  turn and no other: recovered, no progress, failed, stopped by the user, handed over — a
  person started or joined that turn, or edited the queued message before it ran — or
  unverified, which is what an outcome that could not be established is called, rather
  than a success.
- **A failure of our own recovery turn is the same task failing again.** The record that
  follows continues its parent's chain instead of starting a new one: it inherits every
  counter in the one transaction that creates it, and is created already stopped when the
  parent was cancelled, was taken over by a person, or had used up a budget. By default one
  task gets at most six continuations; the setting that governs it accepts one to ten and
  nothing outside that.
- **Stable words for what a recovery is doing.** The engine's own vocabulary is 27 stored
  states in five classes, and the window and the Codex panel never show one of them: they
  read the same 22 public codes, and those never depend on a setting — a recovery that
  failed stays failed even if you raise the attempt limit afterwards. The command line
  still prints the stored state beside the code, for whoever is debugging a recovery.
  Facts about the surroundings that change what a waiting recovery will do next — recovery
  is paused, the conversation is switched off, the watcher is not ticking — are shown
  beside the code
  instead of folded into it, and never on a record that may already have been sent.
- **A journal, and a timeline that reads it.** What happened to a recovery is written down
  as codes, ids, counters and times; no prompt, no reply, no error text can reach it. The
  timeline shows one recovery's whole chain in the same words the lists use, rather than in
  the engine's state names. The journal is bounded at 5,000 entries and 90 days and never
  drops an entry belonging to a recovery that is still running, and nothing reads it back
  to decide anything — the decisions are made from the records.
- **Clear history hides and never deletes.** It changes the History view and nothing else.
  Anything that may still change stays visible — a recovery still running, an unconfirmed
  submission still being reconciled — and hidden rows still count for every cap, cooldown
  and duplicate check, which is what stops a finished failure from being detected all over
  again.
- **Cancel stops one task and everything that continues it.** A record that was never sent
  is cancelled outright; anything that may already be in Codex is marked, and the watcher
  takes back whatever is still queued. A turn already running in Codex is not stopped, and
  the confirmation says so. A record that has already finished is marked too, so no later
  failure of that task can start a new chain from it. Cancelling only ever reduces
  automation, so it does not need Codex to be running, and it is retried for up to thirty
  seconds rather than refused when the watcher happens to be writing.
- **Giving attempts back is explicit, limited, and not a send.** An exhausted recovery
  re-enters the wait its kind of failure needs, and every check runs again from the top. It
  does not switch a conversation back on: if that conversation is off, it says so and
  nothing will run until you switch it on. It can be done three times for one task, after
  which the window says to continue that task in Codex yourself.
- **Retry now is a re-check.** It brings the schedule forward and wakes the watcher. It
  does not send, does not skip the loaded-thread requirement, does not open a usage window
  and does not skip revalidation; a recovery whose usage limit has not lifted simply goes
  back to waiting.
- **Statistics, over the last 7 days, the last 30 or all of it**: how many interruptions
  were detected, how many continuations were sent, how they ended, the median wait before
  sending and the median time to recover, a count by kind, and how many times Retry now was
  used. One final outcome per record, so a late receipt moves a record from unknown to what
  really happened instead of counting it twice. The success rate appears only once five
  recoveries have ended in one of the outcomes it counts; below that it says there is not
  enough data yet.

### The window shows the work

- **Six pages instead of one.** Overview, Pending, History, Statistics, Diagnostics and the
  settings that were already there. They read the same control layer the Codex panel and
  the tools read, and the same state machine the command line reads, so the surfaces cannot
  disagree about what a recovery is doing.
- **No local web server, and nothing opens in a browser.** The pages are native controls,
  and the window talks to one long-lived bridge process — one JSON line per request — in
  place of a process per call. The whole Overview arrives in one round trip, with each part
  failing on its own: a state that cannot be read must not take the status away with it.
- **Every action names the conversation it acts on.** The lists refresh every five seconds,
  so a confirmation that named nothing could be answered about a record that had moved
  underneath it. Each action addresses a recovery by its exact interruption id, and each
  confirmation names the conversation.
- **Retry now is offered only where it can do something.** Not on a recovery whose usage
  reset is still ahead, not while recovery is paused, and not on a conversation that is
  switched off. Giving attempts back is gated differently, and deliberately: it is offered
  on a recovery that stopped at its limit, was not cancelled, and still has resets left,
  including while
  recovery is paused and on a conversation that is switched off, because it sends nothing
  — and where that conversation is off it says so, and that nothing will run until you
  switch it on. Once a task has had its three the button goes quiet and a note says to
  continue that task in Codex yourself.
- **A part that cannot be read is shown as unreadable, not as empty.** "Nothing is waiting"
  over a list that failed to load is the one wrong answer this page must not give:
  recoveries may well be waiting. Nothing that talks to the bridge runs on the window's
  thread, so a slow read cannot stop the window painting.
- **Diagnostics writes a file you can read before you send it.** Export diagnostics... on
  the Diagnostics page writes one JSON file where you choose. It holds the versions, the
  watcher's health, your settings, every record's state, reason and gates, the content-free
  journal and the last 300 lines of each log — enough to explain a recovery that went
  wrong. Conversation and interruption ids become aliases that hold together inside that one
  file and lead nowhere outside it, because the key is random and thrown away with the
  bundle; file-system paths, your Windows user name and anything shaped like an e-mail
  address are replaced. It sends nothing, and it refuses to overwrite an existing file. The
  exception is `errors.log`: it carries exception messages this product did not write, so
  they are redacted the same way but not filtered, and the file says so at the top. Once the
  file is saved, the window says so too: "Diagnostics saved. Ids are aliases and paths are
  removed; read the file before sharing it." `auto_resume diagnostics` writes the same
  bundle from the command line.

### Codex can turn automation down on its own; turning it up asks you first

- **Pause and resume are two tools, and only resume asks.** They were one tool,
  `set_auto_recovery`, that took the direction as an argument — and Codex runs a tool
  without asking unless it is marked destructive, so a conversation carrying someone else's
  instructions could undo your pause in silence. `pause_auto_recovery` still runs without a
  prompt, because pausing only ever reduces automation; `resume_auto_recovery` is marked
  destructive, and so now are `reset_recovery_budget`, `start_watcher` and
  `update_settings`. The prompt is Codex's to show, though: the mark is a request, not a
  lock. That is why `update_settings` offers only the settings the window and the panel
  offer, and refuses the advanced ones — which engine binary to run, how far back to
  look — even from a client that ignores the schema.
- **`get_status` no longer returns where this is installed.** It returned the installation
  directory, which normally contains your Windows user name, into a conversation Codex
  sends to OpenAI. Everything else it returns still goes there, and the skill's commands
  still print local paths; PRIVACY.md lists what each one says.

### Names, caches and replies that came from somewhere else

- **A mutex or stop event created by a lower-integrity process is refused.** Both have
  predictable names in the session namespace, where a Low-integrity process — a browser
  renderer, say — may create objects, and getting there first was enough: a planted mutex
  made every status read say a watcher was running when none was and made the real one exit
  as a duplicate, and a planted stop event made a real watcher quit at startup, silently. An
  object that already exists is now checked, and one labelled below Medium is refused: the
  status reads unknown rather than running, and the watcher refuses to run and writes why in
  its log. What it cannot do is recover anyway — while such a process holds the name,
  nothing at this level can — but it is no longer invisible.
- **The watcher launcher accepts only this product's marketplace.** With no installed
  application it fell back to the newest plugin of the same name in any marketplace's cache:
  another publisher's code, started at sign-in. It now fails closed and reports that it found
  no engine — which means someone who installed from a renamed marketplace has to
  reinstall, rather than have it quietly keep working.
- **The installer no longer upgrades every marketplace on the machine.** It ran `codex plugin
  marketplace upgrade` with no name, and without a name Codex refreshes every Git marketplace
  you have configured and reinstalls those vendors' plugins — other people's software,
  changed by an install that promised to touch only its own. It now names its own
  marketplace, which for the local one it registers does nothing at all.
- **A malformed reply can no longer end the window.** Its JSON reader had no depth limit, so
  a deeply nested document ended the process with a StackOverflowException, which .NET cannot
  catch and which leaves no message behind. It now fails at 64 levels as an ordinary format
  error, and so does truncated input.

### Both programs say which version they are

- **The two executables carry a version resource.** They reported 0.0.0.0, with no product
  and no publisher, in Explorer's Properties and in the SmartScreen and Smart App Control
  prompts — which is exactly where someone decides whether to trust a file they have just
  downloaded. Product, publisher, description, file and product version and copyright are now
  generated from `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, so they cannot drift from the release, and
  because they are a pure function of the manifest they cost the build nothing that had been
  measured: two builds from fresh clones of one commit, on one machine with the same compiler,
  produced a byte-identical archive. That is all that has been shown - another machine has not
  been compared, and no archive published up to v0.5.7 is reproducible at all. The files are still unsigned: this is what a signature
  would have displayed, not a substitute for one.
- **The App Server client tells Codex its real version.** It introduced itself as
  `codex_auto_resume` version "0.1" in every release since the first, and now sends the version from the
  manifest. Codex reports `clientInfo` to OpenAI as the client's identity, so this changes
  what leaves the machine: the name was already going, and the number beside it is now true
  rather than wrong.

### The notification area shows it without opening anything

- **An icon is there while the watcher runs.** It belongs to the watcher process itself, so it
  cannot show a watcher that is not there: it appears when one starts and goes when it stops.
  Its tooltip says whether recovery is paused, how many recoveries are waiting, how many are
  running in Codex, and how long until the next check - counted down on your machine, and
  reaching zero only means the watcher looks again, not that anything is sent. Its menu opens
  the window, pauses or resumes recovery, and stops the watcher. It decides nothing itself:
  everything it offers goes through the same control layer every other interface uses. It is
  on by default and can be switched off in the settings.

### Pause and resume say one thing in Korean

- The Korean labels of pause and resume are now 자동 복구 일시 정지 and 자동 복구 다시 켜기
  everywhere. The window's and the Codex panel's buttons said 복구 일시 중지 and
  복구 다시 시작; both were brought to the words the notification-area menu already used.
  English is unchanged.

### An upgrade repairs; it does not decide

- **Fixed: an upgrade switched automatic recovery back on.** Plain `setup` runs the engine's
  `enable`, so upgrading over an installation whose owner had paused recovery switched it
  back on, silently, under the name of an update. The installer now runs setup with
  `--keep-state` whenever the program directory is already there, and the bootstrap does the
  same on the branch that skips the download because the installed version already matches.
  A first install still enables recovery: there is no decision to preserve, and it has to
  end up watching or nothing is.
- **Fixed: an upgrade put back a sign-in start that had been removed.** With `--keep-state`,
  setup re-registers the sign-in entry only when the entry registered is already this
  installation's — which still repairs its path after the runtime moves — and adds none
  where there is none.
- **Fixed: an interrupted copy was swept away by the next run.** The installer moves the old
  `app\` and `runtime\` aside before copying the new ones over, and the first thing the next
  run does is delete every `*.old-*` directory it finds. A power cut between the two left
  the only complete copy under exactly that name, so the recovery attempt was what destroyed
  the installation. The names every tree will be moved to are now decided before the first
  move and written to a small JSON journal at the installation root — written to a temporary
  name and moved over the real one, so a crash during the write leaves either the previous
  journal or none. The next run reads it before it sweeps anything: it puts back a tree
  whose target is missing, checks both ends of every move against the installation it has
  already proved is its own, and keeps the aside copies the journal still accounts for until
  this run has written a complete one. The journal is deleted once both trees are in place,
  and deliberately left behind when a run fails, because the roll-back is best effort and
  that file is then the only record of where a tree went.
- **Fixed: whatever sat at the payload root was copied into the installation home.** It was
  a wildcard copy, so a stray file in a release went straight into the home, including names
  this product reads as proof that the home is its own (`runtime.json`,
  `.owned-by-codex-auto-resume`) or as state. The two files that belong there — the settings
  window and its icon — are now copied by name, and a payload missing either fails the
  install before anything is moved. The bootstrap's archive check refuses an archive that
  carries anything else at that root.
- **Repair in the window says which of five things happened**: it finished, it is still
  working, another installation or repair is already running, this installation is missing
  the files setup is made of, or it failed — and only the failure carries the last few lines
  setup printed, with the line that is a path dropped. It takes the installer's own lock, so
  two processes cannot rewrite the same registrations at once, and a setup still working
  after two minutes is left to finish in the background rather than killed halfway. It runs
  setup with `--keep-state`, so a repair never undoes a pause or re-adds a sign-in start.
- **Stop watcher is now in the window and on the bridge.** The upgrade-pending message tells
  you to use Stop watcher and then Start watcher; Start was there and Stop lived only in the
  command line, which is the one place a person who uses the window never goes. It is the
  same named stop event the watcher already waits on, signalled once. It asks and never
  kills: a watcher stopped in the middle of submitting a continuation could not prove
  afterwards whether it sent, and a continuation that may have been sent is never sent
  again. It then waits ten seconds for the single-instance mutex — the same probe everything
  else calls "running" — and reports what that said: stopped, still finishing the check it
  is in, not running, or unknown. Unknown is its own answer and is not rounded up to
  stopped.

### It can tell you a new version exists, when you ask it

- **New: Check for updates, in Diagnostics.** Until now nothing in the product knew a newer
  release existed; a person found out by visiting the repository. The Diagnostics page now
  has a button, and `scripts/bootstrap.ps1 -CheckOnly` does the same from a command line.
  Nothing checks on its own: there is no timer, no check when the window opens and no check
  when the watcher starts, because a request to github.com is a request the person's machine
  makes and it should be one they asked for.
- **The answer comes out of a URL, not out of a page.** The check is a `HEAD` request to
  this repository's `releases/latest`, so no page is transferred and none is parsed. The
  version is read from the address the redirect ends at, whose path has to begin with this
  exact owner and repository — a fork, a mirror, or an owner whose name merely starts with
  this one is refused — and is then rebuilt from its three numbers, so what reaches a
  download URL is arithmetic rather than text somebody else chose.
- **Four answers, and four exit codes.** Up to date, an update is available, this build is
  ahead of everything published, or the question could not be asked. The last one is its own
  answer and never becomes "up to date": a machine with no network being told it is current
  is the one wrong thing an update check can say. The window believes an answer only when
  the exit code and the printed line agree.
- **Update reuses the installer rather than adding a second one.** It fetches that release's
  archive, checks it against the checksum published beside it, checks the archive really is
  this product at that version and that no entry escapes the extraction directory, and then
  runs the same `install.ps1` every install runs — which moves the old trees aside, keeps its
  journal, and runs setup with `--keep-state`, so a pause, a per-conversation decision, the
  pending recoveries, the history and the sign-in choice all survive it. A release published
  after this plugin was written cannot have been pinned before it existed, so an update is
  normally verified against the published checksum rather than a pinned digest, and the
  script says which of the two it did.
- **Fixed, before it could ship: an ordinary run after an update installed the older
  version back over it.** An update leaves the machine ahead of the plugin tree it was
  started from, because Codex's copy of the plugin is still whatever version it fetched.
  The next ordinary run of the setup script - which Codex may make on its own - saw a
  version the machine did not have and installed it, over a newer one, silently. An
  installation at the same version or a newer one is now converged rather than replaced,
  and going back happens only when `-Force` asks for it.
- **Whether the watcher actually changed hands is checked, and said.** A still-running old
  watcher reads its version out of the files underneath it, so it starts reporting the new
  version the moment they are replaced. The window compares the watcher's process identity
  and start time across the update instead, and says plainly when the watcher running
  afterwards is the one from before.

### The notification area points at the work, and does not act on it

- **The menu offers a route to what is waiting.** While something is waiting, the icon's
  menu has an item that opens the window on its Pending page, where Retry now, Cancel,
  the timeline and the per-conversation switch are, each naming the conversation it is
  about. Retry now and Cancel are deliberately not in the menu itself: a context menu
  built from a list the watcher is still changing acts on whichever record an id meant
  when the menu was drawn, and a menu item has nowhere to put the name of the
  conversation - which is the thing that stops somebody cancelling the wrong task.
- **The window is only ever opened on a page it has.** The page name reaches a command
  line, so the list of pages it may be is closed, whatever a caller passes.

### The release workflow, the first time a tag actually reached it

- **Fixed: the job that builds a release checked out no tags, and the suite it runs reads
  them.** Four tests build a database with the store code of a real tagged release - the
  upgrade and downgrade paths are tested against the bytes those releases actually shipped,
  not against a description of them - so a checkout without tags makes eight tests fail,
  with the message "CI must fetch the tags". `test.yml` and `sync-ko.yml` had fetched them
  since those tests were written; `release.yml` had not, and nothing noticed for two
  releases because a dispatch stops before publishing and no tag had ever reached the job.
  The first real tag push failed there. Nothing was published: the build job failed, the
  publish job never ran, and the release did not exist to be half-made. The workflow now
  fetches the history, which costs history and not privilege - the token is still not left
  on disk and the job still holds read access only - and a test requires every workflow
  that runs the suite to check out the tags the suite reads.

### Between the old watcher and the new one

- The state file is migrated 1 → 2 → 3 in one transaction, only by the watcher or by a
  caller holding the watcher's mutex, and a copy of the old file is taken first for
  forensics rather than as a restore path.
- Until that happens — between an upgrade and the moment the old watcher exits — the
  interfaces still do the things that only reduce automation: pause, switch a conversation
  off, and cancel a conversation's recoveries the way v0.5 did, thread-wide. Everything else
  says an older watcher still owns the state, and the window shows that sentence where a
  list would be rather than an empty list.
- `downgrade-state --to 2` rewrites the state for a v0.5 release with every interruption
  row kept — cancelled, exhausted, unknown and hidden ones included, because those rows
  are what stop an old failure from being detected and recovered a second time. It keeps
  the rows, not everything about them: the journal and the watcher's own status table are
  dropped outright, and the columns schema 3 added — which Codex turn a recovery started,
  what it inherited from its parent, when history hid it — go with them, because schema 2
  has nowhere to put them. The schema-3 file is copied first, and that copy is the only way
  back.

## v0.5.7 — Security fix

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.5.6...v0.5.7)

A security release, shipped on its own rather than held for v0.6.0, because it closes
a code injection present in v0.4.0 through v0.5.6. Recovery, settings, state and the
install layout are exactly v0.5.6's. Upgrading is the whole remedy - and, as of this
release, an upgrade replaces the running watcher, which is what makes that true.

### Security

- **Fixed: a folder or conversation name could run PowerShell commands.** Affects
  v0.4.0 through v0.5.6; earlier releases put only fixed text, a time and a short id into
  that script. Notifications and the Start Menu shortcut are
  written with a short Windows PowerShell script, and each value - the conversation's
  name, its project folder, the install path - was placed in that script as a quoted
  string with ASCII apostrophes doubled. PowerShell also treats `‘` `’` `‚` `‛` as
  single quotes, so a name containing one of them ended the string early and the rest
  of the name ran as PowerShell, from the watcher, under your account. An ordinary name
  such as `Bob’s project` was enough to stop the notification appearing; a crafted one
  was enough to run a command. Confirmed against the real interpreter before the fix.

  Values no longer become script text at all. They are handed to a constant script as
  environment variables and read with `$env:`, which PowerShell never parses as code,
  so there is no character a name could contain that changes what runs. The tests raise
  every quote-like and interpolation character through the real interpreter and fail
  on the previous code.

- **Fixed: an upgrade left the old watcher running the old code.** The installer renamed
  the program folders under the running watcher - Windows allows that - and the old
  process carried on from the renamed copy until the next sign-in, while setup saw it
  running and started nothing. For this release that would have meant the fix was
  installed and not in effect. The installer now asks the running watcher to stop
  through its own stop request, waits for it, and only then replaces the files; the new
  watcher starts at the end as before. It asks and never kills: a watcher stopped in
  the middle of sending a continuation could not prove afterwards whether it was sent.
  If it does not stop within a minute, the upgrade still completes and says plainly that
  the previous version is still running and how to switch. Measured on real Windows: a
  running watcher is handed over in under two seconds.
- **Fixed: Install.cmd and Uninstall.cmd could run a program planted next to them.** They
  started `chcp` and `powershell.exe` by bare name, and Windows looks in the current
  folder first - so a release extracted into a Downloads folder that already held a
  file called `chcp.bat` ran that file before the installer. Both are now started by
  their full path under `%SystemRoot%\System32`.

## v0.5.6 — Finished, not just working

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.5.5...v0.5.6)

The last v0.5 release, and a quality pass rather than a feature one. **Recovery is
untouched**: the same failure categories, the same refusals, the same exact-thread
identity rule, the same bounded retries, the same database. What changed is everything
around it — the two settings surfaces speak the user's language, the pictures show the
product as it is, and the Korean branch is a Korean branch.

It is also the first release to carry the fixes found after v0.5.5 was published. Those
were deliberately not used to mutate a released artefact; they ship here.

### The settings surfaces speak the language the rest of the product speaks

- **Fixed: the settings window and the Codex panel were English on a Korean machine.**
  The plugin layer resolved a language and used it for notifications and setup output,
  while the window carried its own English literals in C# and the panel carried a third
  set in JavaScript. Three copies of one vocabulary is how "Retry timing" becomes three
  different words. There is one catalog now — 79 keys, both languages — and neither
  surface chooses: the window asks the bridge it already uses, and the panel is handed
  its strings in the page it is already seeded with. Nothing consults
  `navigator.language`, because the four surfaces have to agree and only one of them can
  decide.
- **Fixed: with the window translated, the Korean arrived as mojibake.** The translation
  was correct and the bytes were not. Both front ends run the control bridge with its
  output redirected, and Python encodes a redirected stdout on Windows with the machine's
  ANSI code page — CP949 on a Korean install — while the window decoded UTF-8. The MCP
  server had always reconfigured its streams, which is why the Codex panel was right
  throughout and the window alone was wrong. The bridge now states UTF-8 rather than
  inheriting an encoding, so the protocol's contract belongs to the protocol. What made
  this worth tests rather than a one-line fix is that it hides: a machine with
  `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` set runs the broken code perfectly, so it reproduces for users
  and not for whoever is looking for it — which is exactly what happened here. The round
  trip is checked under a deliberately hostile code page, in six scripts, because the
  contract is Unicode and not Korean.
- The language rule is unchanged and now has tests for the case it exists for: Korean
  when, and only when, the *most preferred* Windows UI language is Korean. Somebody whose
  interface is English and who has also added Korean is a person who reads Korean, not a
  person asking for a Korean interface.
- Retry timing's options are translated where they are shown and stored untranslated. A
  settings file whose meaning changed with the display language would be a bug the user
  could not see until the watcher read it back.

### The bottom row of buttons is drawn in full

- **Fixed: Restore defaults, Save and Close lost their bottom borders.** Reported by a
  user, reproduced, and it was not the buttons. The strip's height was a text measurement
  plus a constant, and the row inside it carries WinForms' default 3px margin, which does
  not scale with the display — so the arithmetic came out two pixels short and the last
  thing living in those two rows was every button's own border. Measured from a layout
  dump of the running window: strip 94 tall, 42 of padding, 52 given to a grid that
  wanted 54. The strip is measured from its content now.
- This is the same shape as the v0.5.5 Retry timing fix, one level up the tree. That fix
  is intact and re-checked.
- The two numbers under Limits no longer sit against the left edge of their boxes. A
  NumericUpDown paints its value hard against the frame, which reads as a number pushed
  up against the box rather than placed in it. WinForms offers the control no inner
  padding, so the space comes from the native edit underneath, through the message an
  edit control has always had for this — the value, its alignment, its range and what
  Save writes are all untouched, and the inset scales with the display like every other
  size in the window.

### The Codex panel looks like the product

- **Fixed: the panel screenshot was malformed, and the panel was why.** 550×494 collapsed
  the card grid to a single narrow column and was shorter than the content, so the image
  ended in the middle of a card with two cards and the entire footer missing. The height
  is measured from the rendered page now, the three cards flow in one grid instead of two
  hand-assigned columns that left one ending a third of the way up, and the pending table
  no longer spreads three short rows across the full width.
- The preview is given a host. Without one the panel correctly renders its read-only
  fallback — every control greyed, and a notice telling the reader to go elsewhere —
  which is a state nobody sees inside Codex. Nothing else about the render changed: it is
  still the exact resource Codex is served, and it is still described that way rather
  than as a photograph of Codex.

### One screenshot set, in the reader's language

- Screenshots are generated per locale and pinned to light. A light settings window above
  a dark panel did not look like one product, and a build on a machine in dark mode should
  not produce different bytes from a build on one in light mode. The runtime still follows
  the user's Windows and Codex themes; only the pictures are fixed.
- One picture is not pinned and cannot be: the notification is a real Windows toast, drawn
  by the shell in the machine's theme, so it is dark in a gallery that is otherwise light.
  The alternatives were to change somebody's Windows theme to take a photograph, or to
  draw a convincing toast in HTML and present it as one — a screenshot that is not a
  screenshot is worse than a mismatched one. `CONTRIBUTING.md` says how to retake it
  on a machine already in light mode.
- The Korean README shows the Korean interface. Korean prose over English screenshots was
  the documentation version of the settings window that would not translate.
- The panel gained the three theme states a themable page needs, so the capture can pin
  one without changing how the served page behaves anywhere else.

### The dark theme was rebalanced, and one part of it was declined

- The canvas and the surface were four points of lightness apart, so a card did not read
  as a card; the hairline was darker than what it enclosed, which is the wrong direction
  on a dark ground; and the cyan sat at full saturation on an 11px dot that was the
  brightest thing on screen. Same brand, less of the loudest part of it visible at once.
- **The standalone window stays light, and that is a measurement.** A probe painted a
  card, a NumericUpDown, a ComboBox, a CheckBox and a Button in the dark palette: the body
  went dark and the parts Windows draws did not, leaving three white rectangles in an
  otherwise dark window. Fixing that means owner-drawing every native control, and a
  half-dark window is worse than an honestly light one.

### The Korean branch is Korean

- **Every human-facing document is translated.** `CHANGELOG`, `CONTRIBUTING`, `PRIVACY`,
  `SUPPORT`, `docs/BRAND` and `docs/PLUGIN` join the six that were already there. The
  `not_yet_translated` list is gone, because a list of documents nobody has got to is
  indistinguishable from a list of documents nobody will. What stays English is named with
  its reason: the licence, because a translated licence is a second licence, and the Codex
  skill, because it instructs Codex rather than a person.
- **A translation cannot go stale quietly.** The English source each Korean document was
  translated from is recorded, and CI fails naming both files when the English moves.
  Nothing is machine-translated — a person decides what the Korean says, then records it.
  This is the documentation half of the screenshot freshness check, and it exists because
  ko told Korean readers the tool made no network request for three releases after it
  started making one.

### Around the repository

- The five issues opened against earlier versions are closed, each re-verified against shipped
  code rather than against the changelog. The repository has a description, topics and
  Discussions; `SUPPORT.md` now names the second door, because a question that is not a bug was
  previously only offered a bug tracker.

### Carried from after v0.5.5

- The installer no longer ends with "Installed and running." whatever the watcher did.
  Setup returns a third result for "everything was done, but the watcher was not seen
  running", which is neither success nor failure.
- The screenshot freshness check now covers the whole read path the window renders from,
  and hashes text after newline normalisation so a clone can reproduce the digest.
- The Korean sync no longer rewrites inside code fences, checks anchors as well as paths,
  lists files in a way that survives spaces and non-ASCII names, and cannot be disarmed by
  a stray local run.

## v0.5.5 — Say only what you checked

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.5.4...v0.5.5)

The last corrective release before v0.6. **Recovery is untouched** again: the same failure
categories, the same refusals, the same identity rules, the same bounded retries, the same
database. What changes is that several things which had been quietly asserting rather than
checking now check - and that the Korean branch stops being a second copy of the product.

### The watcher is reported as running only when it is

- **Fixed: starting the watcher claimed success it had not verified.** `start_watcher`
  returned as soon as Windows created a process, which proves nothing about whether the
  watcher survived its imports, took the single-instance mutex or stayed alive. Four
  surfaces turned that into a statement of fact, and the contradiction showed: the MCP
  tool said "The watcher is running." and the very next status said it was not. It now
  waits for the same probe the status line reads — on a monotonic deadline, in several
  short looks — and reports which of four things actually happened: running, already
  running, started but not confirmed, or started and exited. Only the first two are
  allowed to mention a running watcher, and a test enforces it. Measured here, the
  ordinary case now answers in about a third of a second, where the settings window used
  to sleep a fixed 1.2 s and hope.
- The watcher also now retries a momentarily busy mutex once before concluding another
  watcher owns the machine. Every status read takes that mutex for microseconds to test
  it, and a check must not be able to convince a starting watcher that it lost a race to
  itself. A real second watcher holds it for its whole life, so single-instance safety is
  unchanged.
- The settings window makes that wait somewhere other than the UI thread. Removing the
  fixed sleep had moved the wait into the bridge call rather than removing it, and a
  six-second block on a click handler is a window Windows greys out and retitles. It now
  dispatches to a worker and comes back through `BeginInvoke`; measured by forcing the
  full window, 11 of 24 samples were unresponsive before and 0 of 48 after.

### Screenshots that cannot go stale quietly

- **Fixed: every screenshot showed v0.5.2**, three releases behind, because there was no
  script that made them — only a sequence somebody had to remember. `build/make_screenshots.py`
  now renders both from the working tree: the settings window from a scratch installation
  assembled out of `src/` and the manifest, and the Codex panel from the panel's own
  source with sample data built by the real control surface. There is no version number
  in the generator and no mock JSON on disk; change `.codex-plugin/plugin.json` and both
  images say the new version.
- The same picture is no longer *captured* twice. There is one canonical asset per
  screenshot and the documentation copy is generated from it — both files are still
  committed, and a test now requires them to be byte-identical, which is the point.
  `assets/screenshots.json` records what they were rendered from, so the suite fails when
  the sources move and the images do not.
- What "rendered from" means was itself wrong at first: a hand-written list of seven files
  that missed five which visibly change the pictures, and that fired on edits which cannot
  change a pixel. The panel is no longer hashed from a file list at all — it is hashed
  from the markup it renders, so the version, the schema, the fields a row carries and the
  palette all reach it wherever they live, and a comment cannot fire it. Text inputs are
  hashed after newline normalisation, because `.gitattributes` gives `*.ps1` a different
  byte sequence on checkout than the repository stores.

### The Retry timing control is drawn in full

- **Fixed: the Retry timing box lost its bottom border at every display scaling above
  100%.** Not a drawing bug: a ComboBox under-reports its height until it is shown, then
  resizes itself to fit the font while keeping the position it was given, so it hung past
  the bottom of its own row — by 2 px at 125% and 9 px at 250% — and a child is clipped to
  its parent. The editor is now anchored to the top, and the row reserves the editor's
  measured height, which also puts the label back on its centre line.

### The Korean branch is generated, not maintained

- **Fixed: `ko` was three releases behind, and wrong in the ways that matter.** It was an
  independent fork carrying its own engine, installer, workflows and tests, kept in step
  by someone remembering to merge. It still told Korean readers the tool made no network
  request, still led installation with "download the release archive", still said there
  was no third party to report a security issue to, and still described an uninstall that
  predated every ownership rule v0.5.4 added. Its README linked to itself for the English
  version.
- There is no second copy now. `ko` is main's tree at a commit whose tests passed, with
  each Korean document put in place of its English sibling. `.github/workflows/sync-ko.yml`
  does it automatically, from the SHA that was actually tested rather than whatever main's
  head is by then, and it refuses a run from a fork or from a red main.
- The Korean text moved to main where it can be reviewed. `SECURITY.ko.md` had its three
  false claims corrected and its six-line uninstall section replaced with the current
  ownership rules before it was carried; `README.ko.md` gained the requirements, the
  two-watchers refusal, the safety model and the known limitations, so a Korean-only
  reader is no longer sent to the English page for them. `docs/PLUGIN.md` and the
  changelog are listed as untranslated rather than shipped stale — an English page is
  accurate, and a stale translation is not.
- The tests reach `ko` and now run there. They were carried unchanged, which was true of
  the files and false of the outcome: the sync deletes the Korean sources twelve of them
  read, so the suite errored on the branch it ships to and a pull request opened against
  `ko` was answered with failures about the wrong thing. Those tests skip on a generated
  checkout, and the workflow runs the suite against the tree before publishing it.
- Links to a Korean document are rewritten in both halves, target and visible label, and
  across every page rather than only the five that are translated — `CHANGELOG.md` had
  been shipping to `ko` with a live link to a file the same sync had just deleted. The
  generated tree is now checked for relative links to files it does not contain.

### Housekeeping

- **Fixed: 83 tests were skipped for anyone running a test file directly.** Six files kept
  their `unittest.main()` guard in the middle, so the classes below it never existed by
  the time it ran. `unittest discover` was never affected, which is why nothing said so.
- Both workflows now declare a concurrency group. The release workflow's refusal to
  republish a version reads the release's assets and then uploads, which two runs of the
  same tag could both pass; serialising by tag closes that window.
- Bumping the product version no longer turns the suite red for a reason that is not about
  the product: `scripts/release.json` no longer needs a placeholder entry added by hand.
  What it does check now is the direction that matters — that a version which was released
  did not stay unpinned.

## v0.5.4 — Prove it before you delete it

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.5.3...v0.5.4)

The final v0.5 hardening release. **Recovery is untouched**: the same failure categories,
the same refusals, the same identity rules, the same bounded retries, the same database.
What changes is that installing, updating and removing this product now act only on things
they can prove belong to them.

Four of the five issues this closes were the same mistake in different places — a *name*
being taken as evidence of ownership. Reviewing the fix for one of them found the same
mistake, unreported, on the install path, where it was worse.

### Nothing is destroyed without proof of ownership

- **Fixed: installing had no ownership check at all.** Issue #1 was reported against the
  uninstaller, and fixing only that left the more dangerous half in place: the install
  path also sweeps `*.old-*`, moves `app` and `runtime` aside and then deletes what it
  moved — under the same environment-variable root, with no check. The uninstaller would
  refuse a stranger's directory while an install into that same directory deleted their
  files and finished with "Installed and running." (Reproduced, on a directory holding
  real files, before and after the fix.) The install path cannot ask the uninstaller's
  question — the first install of all happens into a directory that is not ours yet — so
  it asks the other half: a directory already holding `app`, `runtime`, `config`, `logs`
  or a set-aside copy, with no proof any of it is ours, is refused and left untouched; a
  directory holding none of them has nothing to destroy and is claimed *before* the first
  file is written. Every deletion in the installer now goes through the one gate, and
  there is a test that fails if a new one does not.
- **Fixed: the uninstaller could delete directories it never created.**
  ([#1](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/1)) The
  installation root comes from an environment variable, and the PowerShell uninstaller
  removed `app`, `runtime`, every `*.old-*` and — with `-Purge` — `config` and `logs`
  beneath it, with no check at all. Pointed at a directory that merely *contained* folders
  with those names, it would have deleted them. Now the root has to be one we created, and
  the answer comes from the engine's own provenance rule rather than a second
  implementation in PowerShell that could drift from it. Every path is then re-checked
  against the canonical root before deletion, resolving each component, so a junction
  inside the installation cannot redirect a recursive delete out of it.
- **Fixed: the installer force-stopped any process named `codex-auto-resume-mcp.exe`.**
  ([#2](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/2)) A
  filename is not ownership: another installation, a build, or a test fixture running under
  that name was killed by an unrelated install. The executable's resolved path now has to
  lie inside this installation or this plugin's own Codex cache, and a process whose path
  cannot be read is skipped — not being able to tell is not permission to kill.
- **Fixed: uninstall removed the Codex marketplace by name.**
  ([#5](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/5)) If you had
  repointed `codex-auto-resume-windows` at a fork of your own, removing this product took
  your configuration with it. Both the marketplace and the installed plugin are now checked
  against where they currently point, read from `codex plugin marketplace list --json` and
  `codex plugin list --json`, and left alone with an explanation when they are no longer
  ours.
- The same rule already covered the sign-in entry, the notification identity, the Start
  Menu shortcut and the notification handler as of v0.5.3.
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) now states it once, for every kind of resource.

### Removing says what actually happened

- **Fixed: a removal Codex refused was reported as a removal.** The plugin and marketplace
  removals threw their exit codes away, so when Codex declined — it holds the plugin cache
  open while the app is running, the same refusal the install path handles by name — the
  uninstaller deleted the program files anyway and printed "Removed." over the top, leaving
  Codex pointing at a directory that no longer exists. Both are now checked, and the branch
  no longer ends on an unqualified success.
- **Fixed: a purge that could not finish could not be retried.** When files were still in
  use, uninstall correctly stopped and asked you to close Codex and run it again — but it
  had already deleted the proof of ownership the retry needs, so the second run refused the
  half-removed installation and there was no way forward. The proof is now the last thing
  to go, after the step that can still stop the run.
- **Fixed: `powershell -File build/make_gui.ps1`, the command `CONTRIBUTING.md` gives, did
  not work.** `$PSScriptRoot` is empty while parameter defaults are bound, so the two
  defaults derived from it threw. Invoked the other way — which is how CI does it — it
  happened to work, so only the documented route was broken.

### A published version is immutable

- **Fixed: a published release asset could be replaced.**
  ([#4](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/4)) The
  workflow had a path that rebuilt an existing tag and re-uploaded over its assets. Since
  the plugin's bootstrap pins that version's SHA-256, a replacement would make every
  install of that version fail — or, worse, succeed with bytes the digest does not
  describe. Publishing now refuses outright if the version already has assets; a
  correction needs a new version. What remains of the manual dispatch is a dry run that
  builds and verifies but cannot touch a release.
- Published archives now carry **build provenance**, attested before publication, so a
  download can be traced to the workflow run and commit that produced it.

### Already fixed, now proven

- **[#3](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/issues/3) was fixed
  in v0.5.3** by explicit Windows argument quoting. It now has regression evidence rather
  than a claim: every case the issue lists — a home with a space, a folder like
  `OneDrive - Company`, a trailing backslash, an embedded quote, a non-ASCII path — is
  round-tripped through `CommandLineToArgvW`, the function Windows itself uses to split a
  command line.

### Settings at high DPI

- **Fixed: the settings window clipped its own labels at 200% scaling.** Windows Forms
  scales the font and leaves explicit pixel sizes exactly as written, so the window kept
  its width while its text doubled. Every fixed size now scales with the display, and the
  window is additionally clamped to the working area, because 780 units at 250% is wider
  than a 1920-pixel screen. The DPI comes from Windows rather than from `DeviceDpi`, which
  reports 96 on a 192-DPI screen unless a .NET Framework opt-in this product does not ship
  is present — a fix written against it changes nothing, and there is a test saying so.

## v0.5.3 — Say what the network does, and close the v0.5 line

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.5.2...v0.5.3)

The last v0.5 release. **Nothing about recovery changes** — same failure categories, same
refusals, same identity rules, same database, same bounded retries. What changes is that the
documentation now matches the product v0.5.2 turned it into.

### The privacy wording was left behind by plugin-first install

Until v0.5.2 this project made no outbound request at all, and said so in the strongest terms
available. Then the Codex plugin became the recommended way in, and the plugin installs the
product by downloading its release. Those sentences became false on the same day, in five
files and two languages.

- **[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) is restructured** around the distinction that now matters: what
  the running watcher does, and what installing it does. The watcher's promise is unchanged
  and is still the strong one — nothing under `src/` imports a networking module, so it
  cannot open a connection even by accident. Installing from the plugin fetches one archive
  (and its checksum, when no digest is pinned) from github.com and nowhere else. It uploads
  nothing, but GitHub sees the request and counts the download, and this release stops
  implying otherwise. The release-archive route still touches no network at all.
- **Fixed: "Third parties: none."** GitHub is one, at install time.
- **Fixed: "the fact that you installed it at all" never leaves your computer.** On the
  recommended route it does.
- **Fixed: the tool launches more than `codex queue`.** It also runs `codex app-server
  --stdio`, two short interface probes, and PowerShell for the Restart Manager and toasts.
- **Fixed: it keeps state outside its own directory.** The sign-in value, the notification
  sender identity, the notification button's URL handler and the Start Menu entry are all
  per-user Windows registrations, and they are now listed where the storage is described.
- **Fixed: [SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md) pointed at a private security channel** that
  [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) says does not exist.
- **Fixed: `docs/PLUGIN.md` claimed nothing downloaded is passed to a shell** — while the
  bootstrap runs the installer out of the archive it has just unpacked. The claim that holds
  is narrower: nothing from the network is *piped into* a shell.
- **Fixed: the bootstrap's own header overstated what `-ArchivePath` checks.** A local file
  has no sidecar to fetch, so without a pinned digest for that version only the contents
  checks stand behind it. It now says which of the three cases it took.

### Install and uninstall bugs an adversarial re-audit turned up

None of these change recovery. All of them are cases where the product did something
other than what it said.

- **Fixed: the plugin was never registered for anyone whose user folder has a space in
  it.** `Start-Process -ArgumentList` joins its arguments with spaces and quotes nothing,
  so a marketplace path under `C:\Users\Example User\` arrived at `codex` as two
  arguments. Registration failed, the failure was only a warning, and the installer still
  ended with "Installed and running." The watcher and the settings window worked; the
  skill and the panel the user had asked for were simply absent. The installer now quotes
  the way `CommandLineToArgvW` reads back — the same rule the sign-in entry has used since
  v0.5.0 — verified by round-tripping through that function.
- **Fixed: "uninstall aborted before deleting any state" was true only of state.** The
  fail-closed check for a running watcher ran *after* the autostart value, the
  notification identity, the Start Menu entry and the toast handler had already been
  removed. Refusing therefore left an installation that still ran and still had pending
  recoveries, but no longer started at sign-in and could no longer show a notification.
  The check is now the first thing the command does.
- **Fixed: uninstalling one copy silenced another copy's notifications.** The Start Menu
  shortcut and the notification identity are per-user singletons at fixed locations, so a
  second installation overwrites them rather than adding its own — and they were removed
  with no ownership check, unlike the autostart and the URL handler beside them. They now
  get the same check, and say whose they were when they keep them.
- **Fixed: `Uninstall.cmd` threw away the exit code of the step that refuses to remove a
  running installation**, then deleted the engine and the interpreter anyway and reported
  success.
- **Fixed: uninstall reported "Removed." after a removal that half-failed.** With Codex
  open, its MCP server holds the bundled interpreter's images open and they cannot be
  deleted. The install path has stopped those launchers first since v0.5.1; the uninstall
  path now does too, and checks afterwards rather than swallowing the error.
- **Fixed: the plugin's setup script failed every download on PowerShell 7.** The check
  on where a redirect finally landed read a property that only exists on Windows
  PowerShell 5.1, and under `Set-StrictMode` reading the other one throws. It now reads
  either, and refuses if it can read neither.
- **Fixed: the repair path took no lock.** Re-running setup on an already-installed
  version skips the installer, so it skipped the installer's lock as well and could run
  beside one.
- **Fixed: the MCP launcher was the one component that ignored the install-home
  override**, so moving the installation left the panel unable to find it.
- **Fixed: running the test suite wrote a real registry entry.** One test class guarded
  the registry function by function and had missed `install_protocol`, so every run left
  a `codex-auto-resume:` handler in the user's own HKCU pointing at a temporary directory
  that no longer existed. It was found by an uninstall correctly refusing to remove a
  handler that belonged to "a different installation" — which it did. The class now fakes
  the registry module itself, the way the other test modules already did.
- Smaller hardening in the same script: the file the install actually executes is now in
  the required-contents list; an archive whose manifest differs only in letter case is
  refused rather than crashing; a manifest with no version at all gets the intended
  message; and the case where nothing could be compared no longer prints a tick and a
  hash beside it.

### One property was undocumented rather than overstated

Every `codex` subprocess this tool starts already runs with analytics off, every
OpenTelemetry exporter off, prompt logging off, and the ChatGPT base URL pinned so a stray
local configuration cannot send a continuation somewhere else. That has been true for
several releases and appeared in no document. It does now, and a test keeps it.

### Tests that stop this happening again

`tests/test_privacy_claims.py` asserts the code property the wording rests on — which files
may reach the network, and that the watcher's cannot — and then that no absolute network
claim stands without its qualifier nearby. The checks are shape-based rather than exact
strings, so a rewrite that is still true keeps passing. It guards the other direction too:
the changelog must keep a section for every released tag, so a future sweep for a retired
phrase cannot take the history with it.

### Smaller corrections

- The README no longer implies a screenshot of the Codex panel was photographed inside
  Codex; it is a render of the exact resource the plugin serves, and now says so.
- `watcher_launcher.py` still described the engine-resolution order from before v0.5.2.
- `make_release.py` called the archive byte-identical across builds, three lines from its own
  docstring explaining why it is not.
- The README claimed Python was needed to install the plugin from a marketplace. It is not —
  the setup script is PowerShell — and a duplicated sentence left over from v0.5.2 is gone.

## v0.5.2 — Install it from Codex, and look like one product

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.5.1...v0.5.2)

A patch release. Recovery is unchanged: the same failure categories, the same refusals, the
same identity rules, the same database. What changed is how you install it and what it looks
like once you have.

### Installing it from Codex actually installs it

Adding this plugin from a marketplace used to hand you a source tree and a skill whose first
instruction was to find any Python that would run. That produced a **second, lesser
installation**: a watcher registered against whatever interpreter answered, no settings
window, no panel, an engine loaded from the plugin cache — and if the machine already had a
real installation, both of them sharing one state directory.

- **The plugin now installs the product.** Ask Codex to *set up auto resume* and it runs
  `scripts/bootstrap.ps1`, which downloads the matching release, verifies it and installs it.
  Nothing has to be installed first: no Python, no administrator rights, no manual download.
- **What it is allowed to fetch is narrow on purpose.** One URL shape, built from constants
  and this plugin's own version — no "latest", and no input that reaches a URL, so a v0.5.2
  plugin can ask for the v0.5.2 archive and nothing else. HTTPS with TLS 1.2 minimum, and the
  final response has to come from GitHub.
- **It verifies before it runs anything.** SHA-256 against a digest pinned in the plugin when
  there is one and the published `.sha256` otherwise — it prints which of the two it used
  rather than implying the stronger one — then that the archive contains what a release is
  defined to contain, that its manifest declares this product at this version, and that no
  entry escapes extraction. Any failure deletes the download and stops. Checked against a
  file that is not an archive, a genuine archive declaring the wrong version, and a correct
  archive against a wrong pinned digest.
- The README now leads with the Codex route and keeps the archive route for anyone who would
  rather nothing downloaded on their behalf. Both end at the same installation.

### One installation, whichever way you arrive

- **Fixed: a plugin update could swap the engine underneath an installation.** The watcher
  resolved its code from the newest copy in the Codex plugin cache, by modification time, so
  installing a newer plugin from a marketplace silently replaced the running engine while the
  settings window still talked to the installed one. The installed application now wins.
- **Fixed: setup would configure a watcher with nothing to run it.** It now refuses unless the
  bundled runtime and the application are both present, and prints the command that installs
  them, instead of improvising a lesser installation.
- **Fixed: the sign-in entry could name a different interpreter from the installed one.** Every
  registration setup writes — autostart, the notification handler, the watcher itself — now
  names the interpreter the installer deployed.
- **Fixed: the installer ignored the state-directory override the Python side honours**, so
  setting it deployed to one place and configured another.
- **Two installers can no longer run at once.** A double-clicked `Install.cmd` and a plugin
  bootstrap used to be able to copy over each other's half-written payload.

### A new look

- **The green is retired.** The identity is a deep-blue to cyan ramp that carries the product's
  own behaviour: deep blue while it waits, cyan the moment it acts.
- **A new mark.** Four concepts were built and compared at all nine icon sizes on light and
  dark grounds — `build/icon_concepts.py` still renders the sheet — and the winner is an open
  ring with a bright head at its leading end: the ring is the wait, the gap is the
  interruption, the head is the resume. There is a vector master at `assets/brand/icon.svg`.
- **The settings window and the Codex panel were redesigned together.** State leads on both
  now: what the watcher is doing is the first thing and the largest type, where it used to be a
  muted sentence along the bottom under sixteen checkboxes. What is waiting to resume comes
  before what is configured, and the cards run in the order the argument does — what may be
  recovered, how hard it will try, what it will tell you, when it starts.
- **The plugin card has artwork.** Codex has always validated an icon, a light and dark logo
  and screenshots; this project never supplied any of them.
- **Fixed: white text on the panel's dark-theme accent measured 2.6:1.** Found by a contrast
  assertion, not by looking at it. Text drawn on the accent is now its own colour, and it goes
  dark exactly when the accent goes light.
- **Fixed: the panel asked for a colour variable the generator never emitted.** That is not an
  error in CSS — the declaration is dropped and the text quietly inherits.

### One palette instead of four

Four surfaces carried their own copies of the colours — the settings window in C# literals,
the panel in a stylesheet, the icon renderer, the plugin manifest — and they had already
drifted. The palette now lives in one module; `gui/Brand.cs` and the panel's stylesheet are
generated from it, and tests regenerate both and compare, so a hand-edit fails the suite
instead of shipping. A test also sweeps every tracked file for the retired colours, because
that is how a colour survives a rebrand: in a document nobody reopened.
[`docs/BRAND.md`](BRAND.md) records the decisions.

## v0.5.1 — Say what the product actually is

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.5.0...v0.5.1)

A patch release. No change to how recovery works, what it will retry, or what it refuses to
retry. What changed is everything around that: the documentation was describing a version of
this project that no longer exists, and the install instructions contradicted the installer.

### Documentation that matches the product

- **Fixed: the one-click install told you to put Python on your PATH.** That archive exists
  precisely so you do not need Python — it carries its own runtime. The recommended install is
  now three steps at the top of the README, with no prerequisites, and Python appears only where
  it is genuinely needed: a source checkout, or installing the plugin straight from the
  marketplace.
- **Fixed: "there is no tray icon, no settings window, no management web UI".** Two of those
  stopped being true in v0.5. The project direction now says what is deliberately built — a
  Windows settings window, a panel inside Codex, the command line, notifications — and what is
  still deliberately refused: a tray controller, a management web UI, a supervisor, a service, a
  second recovery engine, a second database.
- **Fixed: the supported Python version was never the tested one.** Setup refused anything below
  3.10 while CI only ever ran 3.12 and 3.13, so two Python releases were accepted by the
  installer and never tested. The floor is now the lowest version that is actually tested, and a
  test ties the installer, the message the user sees, the skill and the bundled runtime together
  so they cannot drift apart again.
- The README opens with the problem and the download instead of the implementation, and states
  the loaded-conversation limitation in the same breath rather than further down.

### New public documentation

- **[PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md)** — what is read, what is stored, and the short answer to what is
  sent anywhere: nothing. No telemetry, no analytics, no update check, no outbound requests.
- **[SUPPORT.md](SUPPORT.md)** — where to report each kind of problem, what to include, and what
  not to paste into a public issue.
- **[CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)** — how to run the tests and build a release, the fixture
  conventions, and the safety properties a change has to keep.
- **[README.ko.md](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/blob/ko/README.md)** — a Korean
  README, linked from the English one.

### Repository hygiene

- A new check keeps local development environment out of the repository: home directories in
  examples must be placeholders, UUIDs in tracked files must be recognisably synthetic, and
  runtime state is never tracked. The rules describe what a fixture may look like rather than
  listing values, so the check cannot itself become a place where such values live.
- Test and documentation fixtures use the documented placeholders throughout.

### Packaging

- Plugin metadata describes the product in the words people actually search for, and the
  manifest, the skill and the release now agree on the version.

### Unchanged on purpose

Recovery is exactly as conservative as it was in v0.5.0. Same failure classification, same
bounded attempts, same fail-closed behaviour on anything unrecognised, same exact-conversation
identity, same refusal to resend a submission whose outcome is unknown. Codex still has to have
the conversation open for a recovery to be delivered; that limitation is unchanged and still
documented.

## v0.5.0 — Settings you can find, and a notification that says who it is from

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.4.1...v0.5.0)

### Settings, in three places, meaning one thing

- **A standalone Windows settings window**, on the Start Menu. It works with Codex closed, the
  plugin unloaded, the MCP server unavailable, no network, no sign-in and no system Python -
  because configuration matters most exactly when the thing it configures is unavailable.
- **A settings panel inside Codex**, over a plugin-declared MCP server. Ask to open auto resume
  settings and it renders in the conversation.
- **The command line**, unchanged.

All three read and write through one validated layer, so a value set in any of them is the value
the others show. That layer is also the fix for a real bug: the watcher used to have its own
settings reader that understood three of the sixteen fields, and a matching writer that persisted
only those three - so `enable --lookback-hours 8` silently erased every recovery category and
notification preference. There is now one reader and one writer.

### The settings finally govern the watcher

The schema described policy that nothing read. Now the engine adopts it: categories switched off
are never recorded, so nothing is scheduled, attempted or announced for them; the transient
backoff follows the chosen timing preset; and the attempt and no-progress budgets come from the
settings. Changes are picked up on the next poll, without restarting anything.

Policy stays policy. Everything a settings file can touch runs through the same coercion, so the
worst a hand-edited or hostile one can do is make recovery *more* conservative - and the engine's
safety limits are not in the schema at all. There is still no setting that retries an unclassified
failure, resolves a conversation by title, resends an uncertain submission or forces a send.

### Notifications that say who they are from, across the whole lifecycle

- **Fixed: Windows attributed our notifications to PowerShell.** They now show **Codex Auto
  Resume** with this project's own icon. That needs two registrations, not one: an
  AppUserModelID supplies the name and icon, and a Start Menu shortcut carrying the same id is
  what makes Windows *draw* the toast. Without the shortcut the platform accepts it, logs it, and
  files it in the notification centre without ever showing it. Found by looking at the screen
  rather than at the event log, which had said "delivered".
- Three more notifications join the first: recovery starting, how it turned out, and recovery
  stopping for good. Each is raised once, from the state change itself, so the notification and
  the record cannot disagree. An uncertain submission is reported as uncertain, never as a
  failure that will be retried.
- Each event has its own switch, plus a master switch, read at the moment of the event.

### Recovery

- **Fixed: an exhausted recovery could not be given its attempts back.** Running out of attempts
  leaves a record in a terminal state, and terminal records may not be reactivated - the guard
  that stops a finished, cancelled or uncertainly-submitted recovery from being restarted by a
  stray write. Resetting the budget therefore raised instead of resetting. Rather than widen that
  guard, the one stop a person may undo now has its own operation: it accepts only the two
  exhausted states, refuses anything cancelled or carrying any sign of a submission, and clears
  the budget and nothing else. The record re-enters the queue as a candidate and every gate runs
  again.
- **Retry now** brings a waiting recovery's next attempt forward. It is not a send: the watcher
  still revalidates, still needs the conversation open, still waits for usage, and still refuses
  anything uncertain.

### The usage-limit checkbox, re-investigated from scratch

Re-checked against `codex-cli 0.153.4` and ChatGPT desktop `26.901.5280.0`. The answer has not
changed: the notice is assembled from compiled message ids inside the Electron bundle, and no
manifest field, MCP surface or hook can address it. A Codex-native form at the moment of the
interruption is now technically possible and is still not shipped, for a stated reason rather
than a technical one - it would push a form into whatever conversation happens to be open, about
a different one that failed, only when Codex is running, and only where a remote feature gate is
on. Nothing was faked in its place. See [docs/PLUGIN.md](PLUGIN.md).

### Three ways an install could quietly stop working

All three were found by using the product on a real machine after a reboot, not by reading
the code. The watcher was not running, and the settings panel was the only thing that said so.

- **Fixed: the autostart command was never quoted.** `subprocess.list2cmdline` quotes only a
  token that contains a space, so an installation under a path without one produced a completely
  unquoted Run value. Under `C:\Users\Example User\...` Windows reads that as the program
  `C:\Users\Example`, and the watcher never starts at sign-in - whether the product works at all
  depended on what the user is called. Every command written to the registry is now quoted by the
  documented CommandLineToArgvW rules, including the notification button's protocol handler and
  the Start Menu entry.
- **Fixed: an upgrade could not replace an installation that was in use.** Codex keeps this
  plugin's MCP server running, which holds the bundled interpreter's DLLs open, and a loaded DLL
  cannot be deleted - so removing the runtime directory failed part-way and left the application
  updated with the interpreter gone. Windows does allow renaming a directory that contains an
  open file, so the old copy is moved aside and swept up later. Everything is moved before
  anything is copied, and a failure at either step puts the installation back exactly as it was.
- **Fixed: Codex could not update the plugin while it was running the plugin.** `plugin add`
  backs up the cache directory and failed with an access error, because the open file is our own
  MCP launcher, which lives inside the plugin - it has to, since Codex accepts only a contained
  command path. The installer now stops just its own launchers and retries once; Codex starts a
  fresh one when it next needs the server.
- The watcher launcher records that it ran before anything can fail, and catches everything on
  the way out. Under `pythonw.exe` there is no stderr, so an early failure left no log line, no
  event and no trace - which is why "did Windows start it and it died, or did Windows never start
  it" could not be answered at all.
- The settings window and the Codex panel offer to **start the watcher** when it is stopped,
  rather than reporting a dead end. It starts the same process the installer starts.

### Packaging

- The plugin now ships a small launcher so its MCP server can start from the bundled interpreter:
  Codex accepts a plugin command only as a bare name or a contained path, and a bare `python`
  would put back the system-Python requirement this product removed.
- That launcher relays the standard streams rather than letting the child inherit them. A child
  started with `CREATE_NO_WINDOW` and no explicit handles gets no usable standard handles, so the
  server waits for input that never arrives and the host waits for a handshake that never comes.

## v0.4.1 — Put the reason back in the notification

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.4.0...v0.4.1)

- **Fixed: the notification never said why it appeared.** Windows renders at most three
  `<text>` elements in a toast and silently drops a fourth, so the four-line layout lost its
  body line: the toast showed the task name, the project and the thread id, but not
  "Codex usage limit reached" or "Codex was temporarily interrupted".
  It now fits three lines - name, reason, then project and the exact thread id together -
  with the reason ordered before the identifiers, because a line that does not fit is lost
  and losing the reason makes the notification pointless. The thread id is still always shown.
  Found by looking at the actual notification, not the generated markup.

## v0.4.0 — Recover more, guess less, install in one step

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.3.2...v0.4.0)

### Recovery beyond usage limits

- **Clearly temporary failures are now recovered too**, on a policy of their own. The two
  are deliberately not merged: a usage limit waits for its real reset timestamp, a dropped
  connection waits on a bounded ladder (5s, 15s, 30s, 60s, 120s) and never longer.
- Classification is **structural, not textual**. It reads the `codexErrorInfo` variant Codex
  itself writes, then an HTTP status carried by that variant. A message is consulted only
  when there is no structured code at all, and only for transport failures that have no code
  (timeouts, DNS, TLS, broken pipe). A structured code is never overridden by message text.
- **Recovered:** usage limit, connection failure, timeout (408/425), transient rate limit
  (429), server errors (500-599, `serverOverloaded`, `internalServerError`), stream
  disconnection.
- **Not recovered:** user cancellation, permission, approval, policy, invalid request,
  context length, permanent authentication (401/403/`unauthorized`), `badRequest`,
  `sandboxError`, `responseTooManyFailedAttempts` (Codex already retried and gave up),
  and anything unrecognised.
- **Unknown is never retried.** An error this tool cannot place is never registered at all,
  so no later stage can act on it. This is the opposite of retrying by default, and it is
  the point: a missed recovery is cheaper than a wrong one.
- **Bounded budgets.** A transient chain stops after 4 recovery attempts
  (`retry_budget_exhausted`), and after 3 consecutive recoveries that produced nothing
  (`no_progress_exhausted`). Progress is judged from lifecycle metadata only: whether a
  later turn completed, and whether it recorded a final agent item. No message text is read.
- **The user always wins.** If a later turn exists on that exact thread - because the user
  carried on, or because Codex did - the old interruption becomes `superseded_by_user` and
  is never resumed on top of the newer work.
- Existing state upgrades in place. Pending recoveries survive the update.

### Notifications that say which task

- The notification now leads with a name a person recognises: the conversation title, else
  the project, else the working directory's name, else "Codex task". The **exact thread UUID
  is always shown** on its own line, because titles repeat and identity must not.
- Wording follows the failure: a usage limit says when it will resume; a temporary failure
  says it is retrying. One cancel button either way.
- Display names are read from `threads.name` only. On this schema `title`, `preview` and
  `first_user_message` all hold the raw first prompt (observed at 67 KB, multi-line), so they
  are never read. Labels are capped and must be single-line, so a schema change cannot turn a
  prompt into a notification.
- **Names are for display only.** Recovery still resolves nothing by title, project or
  recency; the exact UUID remains the sole identity.

### One-click installation

- `install/Install.cmd` registers the marketplace, installs or updates the plugin, checks for
  Python, and hands over to the plugin's own setup. It is a bootstrapper, not a runtime: no
  administrator rights, no service, no scheduled task, HKCU only, and it never deletes state.
  Re-running it upgrades in place. `Uninstall.cmd` reverses it, watcher first.
- Python is never downloaded or installed automatically; a missing interpreter is reported
  with a link and the installer stops without leaving anything running.
- Checked first and not available: this Codex build has no plugin install deep-link, and
  `codex plugin add` requires a registered marketplace, so the two commands cannot be reduced
  to one officially.
- Fixed while testing the installer for real: a single-result PowerShell pipeline is a scalar,
  so indexing it took the first character of the engine path; an already-registered marketplace
  kept a stale snapshot, so updates never arrived; the Python version probe's quoting did not
  survive argument passing; and setup compared the registered autostart by exact string, so
  upgrading Python made one installation look like two and setup refused forever.

## v0.3.2 — Make the login autostart actually start

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.3.1...v0.3.2)

- **Fixed: the registered sign-in autostart could never run.** The Run value ended in `run`, and
  the launcher appended `run` again, so the command died with an argument error at every login.
  It went unnoticed because starting the watcher from setup passes no arguments and worked fine.
  The launcher now treats its arguments as the command to run, defaulting to the watcher.
- **Fixed: the notification button broke on the next plugin update.** It was registered against
  the plugin's own directory, which is named after its version. It now goes through the same
  stable launcher as the autostart, so neither registration can be orphaned by an update.
- Both registrations are now checked by tests that parse the exact command that gets registered
  and feed it to the real argument parser.

## v0.3.1 — Keep the state out of somebody else's sandbox

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.3.0...v0.3.1)

- **Runtime state moved from `%LOCALAPPDATA%` to `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume\`.**
  Setup may be run from a packaged (MSIX) host, and Windows silently redirects such a host's
  AppData writes into its own private `LocalCache`: the environment variable still reads as the
  normal path while the files land inside an unrelated application. Installing this way put the
  state, the logs and the autostart launcher inside another app's sandbox, where uninstalling
  that app would have taken them with it. The user profile root is not redirected, which is why
  Codex keeps its own state in `~/.codex`.
  Found by installing the plugin for real and reading back where the files actually went.

## v0.3.0 — A control at the moment it matters

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.2.0...v0.3.0)

- **Windows notification when an interruption is detected.** The watcher is running at that
  moment, so this is the one place a control can be offered in time; the Codex turn has already
  failed by then, so nothing can be added to the app's own usage-limit notice.
  The toast says when the conversation will continue and carries a single **Don't resume**
  button. Doing nothing resumes, which is the default.
- The button is handled through a per-user `codex-auto-resume:` URL protocol registered under
  `HKCU\Software\Classes`. It accepts exactly one action — cancelling — so a hostile URI can
  only ever stop a resume, never cause one. The interruption id is validated as opaque hex and
  must match a real record; nothing is resolved by thread name or recency.
- The toast shows only a shortened conversation id and a local time. Never prompt text, error
  text or account data. PowerShell is invoked with `-EncodedCommand`, so no message text can be
  reinterpreted as script.
- Delivery is best effort. A notification that cannot be shown, times out, or raises is logged
  and ignored; it never changes whether a resume happens.
- Turn it off with `"notifications": false` in `config/settings.json`.
- Fixed before release: the toast document was escaped as if it were an XML *attribute*, which
  turned its own angle brackets into entities and made every notification fail silently. The
  document is now embedded as a PowerShell string literal, and a test parses the document out of
  the command that is actually sent.

## v0.2.0 — Install and control it from inside Codex

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/compare/v0.1.0...v0.2.0)

- **Codex plugin.** The repository root is now also a Codex plugin root, with a marketplace index
  (`.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`), a manifest (`.codex-plugin/plugin.json`) and one skill.
  Install with `codex plugin marketplace add songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows` followed by
  `codex plugin add codex-auto-resume@codex-auto-resume-windows`, then ask Codex to set it up.
  There is exactly one copy of `src/`; the engine ships with the plugin rather than being duplicated.
- The plugin is a thin front end over the existing command-line interface. It adds no MCP server, no
  second engine, no recovery logic of its own, and never queues a message to a thread.
- **Runtime state moved out of the plugin directory** for plugin installs, to
  `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume\`. Plugin updates and removals no longer risk pending resumes.
  Autostart points at a small stable launcher that re-resolves the current plugin version at every
  launch, so an update needs no re-registration. Manual installations are unchanged.
- **Two installations are refused rather than merged.** A manual checkout and a plugin install keep
  separate state and separate single-instance locks, so both watchers would run and could each resume
  the same interruption. Setup stops when a different installation already owns the sign-in autostart.
- English by default; Korean only when Korean is the most preferred UI language, read from the same
  source the ChatGPT desktop app uses for its own display language. No language is inferred from an IP
  address, time zone, user name, country or keyboard layout.

### Fixed

- **`uninstall` deleted the Windows sign-in autostart value even when it belonged to a different
  installation**, silently disabling a watcher it did not own. It now unregisters only a value that
  starts the installation being uninstalled, and reports anything else as kept. Found by running the
  plugin's uninstall against an isolated home while a manual installation was registered.
- Setup no longer crashes on a legacy-code-page console: the check mark falls back to ASCII when the
  console cannot encode it.

### Not implemented, on purpose

- A checkbox inside the Codex usage-limit notice. There is no official plugin API that can place a
  control there, and the alternatives are all forms of injection or GUI automation this project does
  not use. No substitute GUI was built. See [docs/PLUGIN.md](PLUGIN.md) for the evidence.

### Also

- Survive Codex app updates instead of stopping at the first version change.
  - Local databases are discovered by schema generation (`state_5`, `thread_history_1`, ...) and
    validated by the columns actually read, so a generation bump no longer breaks detection. Extra
    columns are fine; a missing required column still refuses.
  - The exact engine-version equality check is replaced by a capability probe: a verified version is
    trusted, and an unrecognised one is accepted only when `codex queue` still offers `--thread` and
    `--message`. `status`, `doctor` and the watcher log say plainly when the engine is unverified.
- Report the engine pin actually in force in error messages instead of a hardcoded version.

## v0.1.0 — first public release

[The commits in this release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/commits/v0.1.0)

First public release of `codex-auto-resume-windows`, a local-only Windows watcher that resumes Codex
tasks interrupted by a usage limit.

### Included

- Usage-limit detection that fires only on `status=failed` together with
  `codexErrorInfo=usageLimitExceeded`. Completed, interrupted, ordinary failed, tool-error, malformed,
  and unknown states are never resumed.
- Exact-thread tracking by UUID. `--last` is never used, and one thread's failure can never resume another.
- Reset-aware waiting that uses the real reset timestamp when one is available, with conservative polling
  when it is not, and a live usage re-check immediately before sending.
- A loaded-thread safety guard: the thread must be verifiably loaded in the desktop app, determined from
  the Windows Restart Manager without ever locking the app's own files. Unknown state never sends.
- Safe waiting for unloaded threads instead of any attempt to force them open.
- Duplicate-resume protection that survives process crashes and watcher restarts.
- Durable pending state in SQLite, with support for several interrupted threads at once.
- Bounded retry backoff, a global kill switch, and per-thread enable/disable/cancel.
- CLI: `doctor`, `enable`, `disable`, `status`, `pending`, `cancel`, `logs`, `run`, `stop`, `install`,
  `uninstall`.
- Single-instance protection via a per-user named mutex.
- Optional per-user Windows login autostart, requiring no administrator rights.
- Conservative uninstall that only deletes inside directories it created, and aborts if a watcher may be
  running.
- Rotating logs that never record prompt text, error text, or account identifiers.
- Automated test suite plus an opt-in, read-only live environment check.

### Known limitations

- Only threads already loaded in the Windows ChatGPT/Codex desktop app can be auto-resumed. After an app
  restart an unloaded thread is resumed only once the user opens that conversation again. This is a
  measured limitation, not an oversight.
- The blocking usage bucket cannot always be identified from local history with certainty.
- Pinned to a verified Codex engine version and local schema; other versions are refused.
- The complete end-to-end unattended path has had limited real-world exercise so far.
