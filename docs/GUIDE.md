# Codex Auto Resume — the full guide

Everything about Codex Auto Resume in one place. The [README](../README.md) is the short version.

**Automatically resume the exact same Codex task on Windows after a usage limit resets.**

Codex stops mid-task and tells you to try again at 6:34 AM. You are asleep at 6:34 AM, and in
the morning the task is exactly where it stopped.

Codex Auto Resume waits until the reset time Codex reports for your usage window (a 5-hour or a
weekly one, for example), checks that continuing is genuinely safe, and then
continues **that exact conversation** — so you come back to finished work instead of a stopped
task. It also recovers temporary rate limits, network failures, timeouts, server errors and
interrupted streams, but only where the failure is one it can name and is safe to retry.

It is a small local watcher for the Windows ChatGPT/Codex desktop app. It reads Codex's own
state read-only, classifies what actually went wrong, and sends one continuation message
through the official `codex queue` command. The watcher has no network code of its own, and
nothing is sent to this project. Before a resume it checks your usage by asking the official
Codex binary, which gets the answer from OpenAI; the resumed turn then runs in your desktop app
under your own Codex settings and goes to OpenAI like any turn you start; what this plugin's
tools and commands return in a Codex conversation goes to OpenAI with that conversation;
setting it up from Codex downloads the release from GitHub; and installing with v0.5.7 also has
Codex refresh every Git marketplace you have configured (naming only this one is new in
v0.6.0).

**It deliberately does not retry everything.** A failure it cannot name is left alone.

Codex 0.153.4 records many timeouts, dropped streams and 502/503/504 errors with a generic code; one that carries no HTTP status is not retried, and one that carries a status is classified from it (429 a rate limit, 408 and 425 a timeout, 500-599 a server error, any other 4xx permanent).

| **Privacy** | no telemetry, no analytics, no automatic update check, never reads your credentials. *Check for updates* in the window asks GitHub which release is newest - and, from v0.6.11, reads its list of releases on api.github.com for a newer pre-release, which it installs only if you say yes - and only when you press it; *Install another version...* reads that whole list there, page by page, when you open it and again when you confirm a version, and downloads only the version you confirmed; *Check for updates* and *Refresh compatibility data* also fetch the Codex compatibility data from raw.githubusercontent.com, sending nothing about your machine. The watcher has no network code; the usage check, the resumed turn and what the plugin's tools and commands return in a conversation go to OpenAI through Codex, as Codex's traffic always does; setup downloads the release from GitHub; and the v0.5.7 installer has Codex refresh every Git marketplace you have configured (naming only this one is new in v0.6.0) |

**Not the only tool in this space, and not the right one for everybody.** If you want the widest
possible recovery, an agent other than Codex, or a platform other than Windows, one of the
others will suit you better — [`docs/COMPARISON.md`](COMPARISON.md) is a map of ten of
them, re-surveyed on 2026-09-12, saying what each does better than this one.

## Install

**Windows 10/11. No Python needed. No administrator rights.**

### With the setup program (recommended)

Download `CodexAutoResume-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe` from the
[latest release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases/latest) (every release
carries one from v0.6.11 on) and double-click it. That is the whole install: there is nothing to
unzip.

<img src="images/install-motion.png" alt="The setup window installing Codex Auto Resume, drawn by the window's own code: the Welcome page, Next, the choices before it installs, Install, the steps of the installation one after another as the bar fills, and the finished page with the watcher running and Open the Dashboard ticked" width="450">

The setup program is the release archive of [From the release archive](#from-the-release-archive)
in one file. It carries that archive byte for byte, with the archive's SHA-256 beside it. When you
start it, it checks the archive against that digest and stops if they differ, unpacks it into a new
folder of its own in your temporary folder, runs the archive's own `Install.cmd` there - the same
installer - and then removes that folder. From v0.6.16 it does this in a window of its own, in the
Dashboard's look - the theme your installation is set to, where there is one - and in your Windows language (you
can pick another): it says what it installs, which
edition and version, and where; asks only what the installer has a choice about - whether to run at
Windows sign-in on a first installation, and whether to change the edition when the other one is
installed - shows how far the installer is and which step it is on, and ends by saying whether it
finished, with the installer's exit code and its log, and offers to open the Dashboard. Run where its own
version is installed already, it first offers Repair, which installs it again in place and keeps your settings,
everything waiting and the sign-in choice, or Remove, the uninstall with its question about the settings and the
recovery history; a newer version updates as before, and `-Silent` asks neither. No console window
opens. When it updates an installation whose Dashboard is open, it asks that Dashboard to close and opens it again
on the new version where it was, as it starts the watcher again. A Dashboard of a version before v0.6.16 cannot be
asked: it is closed as you would close it, and opens again on the new version on the page it was opened on, or the
Overview. A Dashboard with unsaved Settings changes keeps them and stays open, on the previous version until you open
it again, and the installer says so only of such a window. With `-Silent` it does the same. It downloads nothing, needs no administrator rights and brings no Python of its
own: the installation runs on the Python inside the archive. It loads DLLs from Windows' System32
folder only, so a DLL lying beside it in Downloads is never loaded, and it stops if a `.config` file
is beside it. Started from a command line, it passes switches such as `-SkipStartup` on to
`Install.cmd`, and refuses anything but switches and plain words.

From v0.6.16, `-Silent` installs without a question and without waiting for a key:
`CodexAutoResume-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe -Silent`, which is how `winget` runs it. Nothing else changes: it prints what
it prints and ends with the exit code it ends with otherwise (0 done, 1 stopped, 14 when the other edition is
installed, in which case nothing is changed, since nobody can be asked). It is a Windows program rather than a
console one, so that no console window opens when it is double-clicked, and PowerShell does not wait for a Windows
program it only starts: there, in the folder it is in, run `cmd /c .\CodexAutoResume-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe -Silent`,
which waits, shows its lines and leaves its exit code in `$LASTEXITCODE`. `winget`, a `.cmd` script and `cmd /c` wait for it as they are. The
same switch works on the archive's `Install.cmd` and `Uninstall.cmd`, and the setup program does not wait for Enter
when it stops.

From v0.6.16 an installation also appears in Windows' Settings > Apps and in `winget list`, as *Codex Auto Resume*
(*Codex Auto Resume Advanced* for the advanced edition), for your Windows user only. Its Uninstall button runs the
uninstaller the installer keeps in `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume\uninstall\`, the same one as `Uninstall.cmd`, in
the same installer window: it asks whether to delete the settings and the recovery history too, and shows the
removal as it goes. `winget uninstall` runs the same uninstaller with `-Silent`, with no window.
A change of edition replaces the entry with the other edition's, and an update rewrites it. An installation placed
elsewhere with `CODEX_AUTO_RESUME_PLUGIN_HOME` gets neither the kept uninstaller nor an entry.

It is not code-signed (see the end of [From the release archive](#from-the-release-archive)), so
SmartScreen may show *Windows protected your PC* when you start it. Choose **More info**, then
**Run anyway**. That warning says the file is unsigned and has no reputation with Microsoft yet; it
does not say whether this is the file this project published. The `.sha256` published beside it and
its attestation do. In PowerShell, in the folder you downloaded it to:

```powershell
(Get-FileHash .\CodexAutoResume-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
gh attestation verify .\CodexAutoResume-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe `
    --repo songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows `
    --signer-workflow songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/.github/workflows/release.yml `
    --source-ref refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
```

The first value must match the `.sha256` file. `scripts/release.json` pins archives, not setup
programs; the archive a setup program carries is the pinned one, and
[`docs/VERIFY.md`](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/blob/main/docs/VERIFY.md)
shows how to check that as well. The digest the program checks by itself catches a damaged
download, not a replaced one: whoever could change the archive inside could change the digest
beside it. Where Smart App Control is turned on, it may block the setup program outright, with no
**Run anyway**, as it may block the unsigned files the other routes run; this project does not ask
you to turn it off.

### From Codex

Add the plugin, then ask Codex to **set up auto resume**.

```
codex plugin marketplace add songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows
codex plugin add codex-auto-resume@codex-auto-resume-windows
```

Codex will run the plugin's setup script, which downloads the matching release from this
repository's releases over HTTPS and checks its SHA-256 against the digest recorded for that
version in the plugin's
[`scripts/release.json`](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/blob/main/scripts/release.json).
That digest is committed to this repository after the release is published; it does not come
from the release itself. A version with no digest in the plugin's copy of `release.json` is
checked against the `.sha256` published with the release instead, and the script says so. That
covers a version newer than the last recorded digest, and always the installed plugin's own
version, because a release cannot contain its own digest and after installation the plugin runs
from the installed copy. It then checks the contents really are this product at this version,
and only then installs, for your Windows user only: files in the installation folder (by
default `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume`), a Start Menu entry (when notifications are on, as
they are by default), per-user registry values, and
this plugin's marketplace and plugin registration in Codex, pointed at that installation. The
plugin's instructions have Codex tell you before it does any of that.

This route downloads the matching published archive. Archives v0.5.0 through
v0.5.7 were built by the earlier single-job release workflow, with GitHub Actions referred to
by floating tags and executables that cannot be rebuilt byte for byte. Step 2 of [From the
release archive](#from-the-release-archive) lists what replaces that; those changes are new in
v0.6.0.

The plugin as added from GitHub carries the skills, that setup script and the engine's Python
source, but no interpreter to run that source, and its manifest declares no MCP server (the
`.mcp.json` the release adds points at an executable that only the release contains); the running
watcher, the settings window, the panel's own server and the Windows runtime all come from
that release. That is why there is a download, and why it is worth reading
[`docs/PLUGIN.md`](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN.md)
if you would rather know exactly what the script will and will not do before running it.

### From the release archive

If you would rather download the release yourself instead of having the plugin's setup script do it:

1. Download `CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip` from the
   [latest release](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases/latest).
2. **Verify it before you extract it.** `Install.cmd` does not verify the archive it came in (no
   hash, no signature), so this step is the check. In PowerShell, in the folder you downloaded it to:

   ```powershell
   (Get-FileHash .\CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
   ```

   The value must match the `.sha256` file published beside the archive, and the digest
   recorded for that version in
   [`scripts/release.json`](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/blob/main/scripts/release.json)
   on the `main` branch (`Get-FileHash` prints capital letters; the case does not matter). The
   `.sha256` comes from the same place as the archive, so it shows the download is intact; the
   `release.json` entry is a commit in this repository, not a release asset, so it is a separate
   record: changing it takes a new commit on `main`. It is added after a
   release is published, so a brand-new version may not be listed yet, and anything before
   v0.5.2 has no entry; the attestation check
   below does not depend on it. With the GitHub CLI you can check which workflow run and commit
   built the archive (archives from v0.5.4 on carry an attestation):

   ```powershell
   gh attestation verify .\CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip `
       --repo songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows `
       --signer-workflow songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/.github/workflows/release.yml `
       --source-ref refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
   ```

   If anything does not match, delete the file and do not run it.
   [`docs/VERIFY.md`](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/blob/main/docs/VERIFY.md)
   explains each check and what it does and does not prove. Archives
   v0.5.0 through v0.5.7 were built by the earlier single-job release workflow, which referred
   to its GitHub Actions by floating tags and produced executables that cannot be rebuilt byte
   for byte. Separate build and publish jobs, actions pinned to exact commits, and reproducible
   executables are included in the published v0.6.0 release.
3. Extract it anywhere and double-click **`Install.cmd`**.

The archive carries its own Python runtime, so there is nothing to install first, and the
recommended settings are already on when it finishes. `Install.cmd` downloads nothing itself:
it registers the Codex plugin from the files in the archive, so this route gets the panel too.
It does ask Codex to refresh marketplaces, though. The installer in v0.5.7 and earlier asks
Codex to refresh every Git marketplace you have configured. From v0.6.0 the
installer names only this product's marketplace, which does nothing for the local
registration it has just made; Codex fetches only if an earlier GitHub registration of that
marketplace survived the repoint.

Nothing this project builds is Authenticode-signed: not the two executables, not the setup
program, not `Install.cmd` or `Uninstall.cmd`, and not its PowerShell or Python scripts. The bundled Python interpreter
keeps the Python Software Foundation's signature (`pythonw.exe`, `python.exe` and the Python
DLLs; its two Visual C++ runtime DLLs are signed by Microsoft), and the watcher runs under that
`pythonw.exe`. On the setup program's route SmartScreen asks about the setup program alone: what
it unpacks carries no downloaded-file mark, so the `Install.cmd` inside is not asked about again.
On every route, Smart App Control, where it is turned on, may block the two
unsigned executables: the settings window `CodexAutoResumeSettings.exe` and
`codex-auto-resume-mcp.exe`, which Codex starts for the plugin's tools and panel. On this manual
route it may also block `Install.cmd` and `Uninstall.cmd`, and SmartScreen may warn of an
unknown publisher, because Explorer keeps the downloaded-file mark. Such a warning or block means the file is unsigned and has no
reputation with Microsoft yet (or is a script type downloaded from the internet); it does not
tell you whether the file is the one this project published. Step 2 does.

### Either way

Every route ends at the same installation, by default in `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume`: one
watcher, one database, one settings file, one sign-in entry. Running any of them again is the
upgrade and the repair path, and keeps anything already waiting to resume. An upgrade asks the
running watcher to stop and waits up to a minute so the new version takes over; it never kills
it, and if the old one is still finishing it leaves it running and says so. If Codex cannot
replace the plugin because this plugin's own MCP launcher is holding its files open, the
installer force-stops that launcher and tries again; Codex starts a new one when it next needs
it. If Codex still cannot replace it, the installer says so and finishes everything else: the
plugin's tools already run the program just installed, and only the skill's text in Codex's own
copy of the plugin waits until you close the ChatGPT/Codex app and run the installer again. From
v0.6.11, when the installation changed edition, the installer says which edition that copy still is,
and the Dashboard's Diagnostics says so too until the copy is replaced. `Uninstall.cmd`, or asking
Codex to remove it, removes it; see [Uninstall](#uninstall) for what each route leaves behind.

**Check for updates**, on the Dashboard's Diagnostics page, asks GitHub whether a newer release has
been published and offers to install it. From v0.6.16 - when the installation that checks is v0.6.16 or later; an
earlier version installs its update the way it always did - the install runs in the setup program's window: once the
download is checked it shows the version it goes from and to and what is new in it, read from that download, and
installs only when you press **Update** (**Not now** installs nothing); then it shows how far it is and its log, and
"Updated to" with the first lines of what is new. Everything that ran before then runs again on the new version by
itself: the watcher - unless you had stopped it and it does not run at sign-in - with its notification-area icon,
and this Dashboard, which opens again in the new version. An update with `-Silent` starts the watcher again the same
way, and opens no window. From v0.6.11 it also looks for a newer *pre-release*: an
`-alpha` or `-beta` build published before its release is finished, and tested less than a release.
When there is one newer than both the version you have and the newest release, and no release to
offer first, it asks whether to install it - and **Not now** is the button Enter presses. Saying yes
installs that pre-release over the version you have, in the edition you have, after checking it
against the checksum published beside it, and keeps your settings, your pause, everything waiting
and the sign-in choice. Nothing else installs a pre-release: not the watcher, not the panel inside
Codex and not Codex's tools, and `scripts/bootstrap.ps1 -Update` still installs releases only. From
a command line, `-CheckOnly` prints the pre-release it found on a line of its own
(`prerelease: v<version>`), and `-Version <version>` installs it. Where GitHub's list cannot be read, the
answer says that pre-releases could not be checked, beside an answer about releases that does not depend on them;
where GitHub refused because the requests it allows a network (60 an hour, which a VPN or a shared connection uses up
for everyone on it) have run out, it says so and when the limit resets, and **Install another version...** says the
same. The command line prints `releases: rate-limited <reset>` or `releases: unread`.

Afterwards, change anything from **Start Menu → Codex Auto Resume**, or by asking Codex to
*open auto resume settings*.

**Not in Settings > Apps, or not starting at sign-in?** The Codex app and Claude desktop give every program they start
a private view of the registry and of `%APPDATA%`, which Windows itself never reads. An installation or an update run
from inside one of them - the setup program or `Install.cmd` run by an agent, or the Dashboard opened from the icon of
a watcher that Codex started - could leave the entry in Settings > Apps, the sign-in start, the notifications' name,
the link handler and the Start menu entry where Windows does not look. From v0.6.17 the setup programs, `Install.cmd`,
the update script's own repair steps and the Dashboard notice it and run again outside that app by themselves, and a
Dashboard that cannot get out refuses Repair, installing an update, **Install another version...** and a change to
**Run at Windows sign-in**, and says why. That answer rests on what the window was started from, so it can be wrong - a
tab of Windows Terminal, which is packaged too, can raise it; open the Dashboard from the Start menu and do it there. If it happened anyway, open the Dashboard from the Start menu - or, where the Start
menu has no entry, `CodexAutoResumeSettings.exe` in `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume` from File Explorer - and choose
**Repair installation** on its Diagnostics page.

### Installing another version

**Install another version...**, last in the Tools card of the Dashboard's Diagnostics page, installs a
version you choose, in the edition you choose, in place of the one you have: newer or older, standard
or advanced. Two editions side by side are not possible - one watcher per Codex home, one plugin, one
sign-in entry - so it always replaces the installation its window belongs to. It sends nothing to
Codex, and nothing else offers it: not the watcher, not the panel inside Codex, not Codex's tools.

When you press it, it asks GitHub for this repository's whole list of releases, up to five pages of
thirty, and asks nothing before that. It shows every version from v0.6.2 on in each edition it was
published in, newest first; the advanced edition begins with v0.6.11-alpha. A version it cannot install
stays in the list, greyed, and says why: it is the version you have; no archive of that edition was
published under that number; there is no checksum to check it against; its installer predates editions,
so the edition has to be changed first; or your administrator's policy is set and that version does
not keep it ([below](#settings-an-administrator-manages)). If GitHub cannot be asked, or its answer
cannot be read, it says so and lists nothing. Versions before v0.6.2 are not offered: from v0.6.0 and
v0.6.1 the Dashboard cannot check a download, and v0.5 installers do not keep a paused recovery paused,
so from them the Dashboard could not bring you back.

**Pre-releases too.** Pre-releases are offered as releases are, older and newer, in either edition: one
you pick by name and confirm is installed as a release would be, an older one with your state converted
first where it needs that. *Check for updates* still offers only the newest pre-release newer than both
the version you have and the newest release; this list is where you choose any other.

Choosing a row and pressing **Install...** asks first, and **Not now** is the button Enter and Escape
press. The question says only what applies: that it is a pre-release, tested less than a release; that
it is older, so what came since is not in it, and a setting or a value it does not know reads as its
default there and is lost the next time it saves your settings; that your state is converted for it
first (below); that a change to the standard edition takes the advanced features and their code away,
and one to the advanced edition starts every advanced feature off; that an advanced version before
v0.6.11-beta.2 cannot read this version's advanced settings, so every advanced feature is off there and
the settings are kept for later; and that the download is checked against its pinned digest or its
published checksum before anything runs.

Saying yes reads the list again - a version no longer offered as it was shown installs nothing - then
downloads that version's archive (and its `.sha256` where no digest is pinned for it), checks it and its
contents as every install does, and only then takes the install lock. A version that reads an older state - v0.6.11-beta to v0.6.14 and the v0.6.15 hotfix (schema 4), or v0.6.2 to
v0.6.11-alpha (schema 3) - gets the state converted: it then asks the watcher to stop,
waits up to a minute and never kills it, and converts the state as `downgrade-state --to 4` or `--to 3` does: a copy
of the state as it is now is kept beside it, a continuation that may already have gone to Codex becomes
final and is never sent again, a conversation that waited for you or whose continuation Codex may still
deliver is switched off, and Observe only, if it is on, becomes a pause. A watcher that does not stop
within the minute gets nothing installed and its state left as it was, but it was asked to stop and may
still do so afterwards, and nothing starts it again then: if the header says it is not running, press
**Start watcher**. A conversion that fails starts the watcher again and installs nothing. Then the version's own installer runs in the setup window, headed as an install of another version, with the download and the steps filling its bar, and ends with its exit code and its log; it keeps every record, your pause and the
sign-in choice. A version older than v0.6.16 knows neither the entry in Settings > Apps nor the uninstaller kept
for it, so picking one over an installation that has them first removes both. While all this runs, every action button on the page is greyed, **Start watcher**
included.

Where it installed and *Open the Dashboard* is ticked, the new Dashboard opens and this one closes, as after an update. Otherwise the window says whether the watcher now runs the version installed, and, where the state was
converted, how many continuations were made final and how many conversations were switched off. Close
the window and open it again so it runs the version installed. For an older version of the edition you
have, the question also says to come back with *Check for updates* in that version - but only where that
works: from a release, any version's check offers the newest release; from a pre-release, only a version
from v0.6.11-beta.2 on, the first whose check offers pre-releases, and no check changes the edition.
Otherwise come back with this version's setup program, from its release page. If the installer fails
after the state was converted, the state stays converted - it
sends less, never more - and the window says what stays; a copy of the state as it was is kept in the
state folder.

## What it looks like

When a task is interrupted, a card in the product's own design appears beside the notification
area, as **Codex Auto Resume**: which task stopped, why, and exactly which conversation it is.
Doing nothing resumes. **Don't resume** only ever cancels, and **Open Dashboard** only opens the
Dashboard's Pending page. Where a card must not be shown — the session is locked or remote, an
app is full screen, Do not disturb or Focus is on, a screen reader is running, or the card or the
notification-area icon is switched off — Windows' own notification appears instead, with the same
words and the same two buttons; once a card has been seen, a silent copy of it goes to Windows'
notification center, so the history is the same either way. Below is the card as the product
draws it, in the light and the dark theme, rendered off-screen from sample data;
[The notification](#the-notification) says what each line is.

<img src="images/notification-card.png" alt="The notification card in the light theme: Codex Auto Resume with a cyan status light and a Usage limit chip, the task example-project, the line Codex usage limit reached. This task will resume at 08:42., the conversation's exact identifier, and the buttons Don't resume and Open Dashboard" width="388">

Inside Codex, ask to *open auto resume settings* and the panel shows what is waiting and lets
you change most of it, in sections for General, Recovery, Notifications, Continuation message
and Appearance, with a Preview of the exact message the watcher would send and a switch for each
waiting conversation. It follows Codex's light or dark theme unless you choose one under
Appearance, and Codex's reduced-motion preference - and, from v0.6.10, the Reduce motion and the Design
chosen in the Dashboard, which it draws in but does not offer; a language or theme saved there applies at once.
A Custom message is shown there but not edited; that happens only in the Dashboard. This is the
panel's own page, rendered from the exact resource the plugin serves to Codex, rather than a
photograph of the Codex window around it:

<img src="images/settings-panel.png" alt="The Codex Auto Resume panel: a status card saying two recoveries are waiting, the two waiting conversations each with an Auto-resume switch, the interface language, the recovered failure categories, Limits and Notifications folded away, the continuation language and message style, and a Preview of the Standard message for a usage limit" width="680">

The Start Menu opens the Dashboard, a standalone window that works with Codex closed: what the
watcher is doing, what is waiting and when it is next looked at, what finished and how, the
last week's numbers, the watcher's health, and the settings. The light in its header shows what
the watcher is doing. While it is running and recovery is on, the light is cyan and blinks the
way the notification-area icon does: while the watcher watches, the dot slowly dims and comes back,
and once it is lit a small glow spreads from it and draws back in; it breathes the same way while the
watcher waits for a task's reset or retry, turns a small arc while it checks a task that has come due, and blinks a little faster
while it recovers. Paused or stopped, it is plain grey; amber, blinking slowly for as long as it
lasts, means it needs you. The word beside it
always says which. **Theme**, under Settings > Appearance, draws the window, the popup and the
notification card light or dark; its default, *Use system setting*, follows the app mode Windows is
set to. **Theme in Codex**, beside it, is the panel's own: *Same as Theme* (the default, which is how
every panel looked before it existed), *Codex's theme*, *Light* or *Dark* - so the window can keep a
Light or Dark of its own while the panel follows Codex, or the panel can keep one whatever Codex does. When the
interface language or the theme changes - saved in the window, changed in Codex, or Windows
switching between light and dark - the window closes and opens again by itself, on the same page
and in the same place, but never over changes you have not saved. **Reduce motion**, also under
Appearance, stops those animations, and Windows' own animation setting is always honoured; High
Contrast mode drops the shadows and tints, whatever the theme. It is a native window; there is no
local web server and nothing opens in a browser.

**Design**, under Appearance from v0.6.10, draws the Dashboard, the popup, the notification card and
the panel in Codex one of three ways; light or dark is still the Theme's. *Soft*, the default, is
raised, as described above. *Classic (v0.6.2)* is flat, as v0.6.2 was - white cards with a hairline
and a thin accent bar down their left edge, the current tab underlined - and its light breathes with
its glow. *Plain* is flat and grey, with smaller corners, and its light dims without a glow. Every
design moves alike - switches glide and the notification card rises in - and no design stops motion:
Reduce motion, above, does that. v0.6.10 also had *Soft, without motion*, which drew exactly what
Soft draws under Reduce motion; since v0.6.11 it is Reduce motion, and a Dashboard that had it chosen
opens in Soft with Reduce motion on, looking just as it did. The words, the layout and the sizes are the same in every design,
and the Pending and History lists stay plain rows in each. High Contrast replaces every design, and Reduce motion stops the
motion in each. The Design is set in the Dashboard only: Codex draws the panel in it but cannot
change it, and restoring the recommended settings puts it back to Soft. The popup in each design, in
the light theme:

| Soft | Classic (v0.6.2) | Plain |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <img src="images/tray-popup.png" alt="The popup in the Soft design: raised cards on a blue-grey canvas, a well for the counts, and the cyan status light breathing with a soft glow" width="170"> | <img src="images/design-classic-popup.png" alt="The popup in the Classic design: flat white cards with a hairline and a thin accent bar down the card's left edge, and the cyan status light breathing with its glow" width="170"> | <img src="images/design-plain-popup.png" alt="The popup in the Plain design: flat white cards in neutral greys with smaller corners, and the cyan status light dimming and brightening with no glow" width="170"> |

The Dashboard's Overview, the panel and the notification card are pictured in each design too
(`docs/images/design-*.png`).

The window pictures on this page are captured from a scratch installation holding synthetic
records, in the light theme. They show what the windows look like; they do not show a real
recovery, and they are not evidence that one was observed in Codex.

<img src="images/dashboard-overview.png" alt="The Codex Auto Resume Dashboard overview: automatic recovery on, the watcher running and the Codex engine compatible, two recoveries waiting with the next check in a minute and a half, the last seven days' interruptions, continuations sent, recoveries and success rate, and the four most recently finished recoveries" width="680">

Each waiting recovery shows why it is waiting and when it is next checked, and **Why it is
waiting** lists the watcher's safety checks for the selected task as the watcher last recorded
them - from v0.6.11 with a sentence under them saying, in words, what the first check that did not
pass is waiting for: the Codex app, the conversation being opened, the usage reset, and so on. The
**Timeline** of a recovery lists, after its journal, what delivery showed of each continuation: when
it was seen starting a turn in its conversation, that it was handed to Codex and not seen yet, or
that its delivery is uncertain - watched for a day and never sent again. From v0.6.11 the
**Attempts** column shows what a task has used beside what it may have now - `3/4`, or `19/6` after
the limit was lowered, never cut down to the limit - and while the context-cost guard is on the kind
of interruption says how many tokens its conversation had used. The **Auto-resume** switch on each row turns automatic recovery off or on for that
task's conversation. The click carries the exact interruption and conversation the row was
drawn from, and a click that reaches a task which has since finished, disappeared or turned
out to belong to another conversation is refused and changes nothing; either way the switch sends
nothing. **Retry now** only asks the watcher to look again now — every check still applies, and
nothing is sent unless they all pass. **Cancel** stops recovering that interruption and
everything that continues it: a record that was never sent is cancelled outright, one that may
already be in Codex is marked and taken back if it is still queued, and a finished one is
marked too, so no later failure of that task can start a new chain from it. A turn already
running in Codex is not stopped, and the confirmation says so. **Cancel all** does the same to
every waiting recovery, one exact record at a time; there is deliberately no way to retry them
all at once. From v0.6.16 **Rescan and reconcile**, after Cancel all, looks at every waiting recovery
again by the watcher's own rules, once you confirm. One is retired - stopped as replaced by your own
work - only on proof: its exact failed turn in Codex's history followed by a turn you started (a
continuation of this tool's never counts), or, while that history has not caught up with the
conversation's file, the same in the file itself, where nothing after a rollback counts. One that is still its conversation's latest failure
is left waiting exactly as it was, under every check - the reset's grace, a postponement, a hold, the
switches and the budgets - and the watcher is woken to look at whatever is due. Anything it cannot
decide stays as it is and is counted as unresolved, and a recovery that changed while it looked is
skipped. It sends nothing, writes nothing to Codex, gives no attempts back and brings nothing forward,
and it leaves cancelled, finished and in-flight recoveries and History as they are; the note beside the
buttons says how many were retired, rechecked, unresolved and changed meanwhile, and each one's
Timeline says which. **Turn off for this conversation** cancels its waiting recoveries and keeps
automatic recovery off for that conversation until you turn it back on — the Pending and History
pages then offer **Turn on for this conversation**. From v0.6.11 each row also has a menu of its own,
on a right click, Shift+F10 or the menu key: **Postpone** holds that task back 30 minutes, an hour,
three hours or until 09:00 tomorrow, and only ever later - and, last under it, **Don't postpone** takes
a postponement you made away again, back to what the schedule says without it: an objection window's
time, a retry's wait and a usage reset all stay, and Retry now never shortens a postponement;
**Let it continue** lets a task that waits
for you go on, after asking; and **How this conversation resumes** chooses one of the four ways
described under [Quiet hours and how a conversation resumes](#quiet-hours-and-how-a-conversation-resumes)
for that conversation alone. **Let this project resume** and **Hold this project for me** decide for
the project that task's conversation is filed under, as described under
[Observe only, and which conversations and projects resume](#observe-only-and-which-conversations-and-projects-resume).
Last, in the Dashboard's menu only, **Message for this conversation...** gives that conversation a
continuation message of its own, and, from v0.6.16-beta.3, **Add words for this time...** adds words of
yours to that task's next continuation alone, once - both as described under
[The continuation message](#the-continuation-message).
None of them sends anything, each is refused if its row has since become another task, and the
notification-area popup offers the same menu on a right click on a task, but for the message:

<img src="images/dashboard-pending.png" alt="The Pending page of the Dashboard: two conversations waiting, one for the usage reset and one with a retry scheduled, each with a state chip and an Auto-resume switch, the Why it is waiting checklist for the selected task, and Retry now, Cancel, Timeline, Turn off for this conversation and Cancel all buttons" width="680">

From v0.6.11 the Overview's **Waiting** card, **Why it is waiting** for a usage limit, the
notification-area popup, the panel in Codex and `get_status` also show Codex's usage as the watcher
last read it, with how long ago: each window's length, how much of it is used and when it resets -
"Codex usage, read 2m ago: 5-hour 100%, resets 14:42 · weekly 62%, resets 2027-01-18 13:00". On the
Overview it is one line, ending in "..." where the card is too narrow; the others say it whole. When a
weekly limit is used up, **Why it is waiting** also says the day and time it resets, and that Codex's
`/usage` can redeem a reset credit if your account has one - this product never knows whether it does.
A reset that has already passed is not said: the reading is older than it. Nothing is read
for this: usage is read only when a recovery is due, as it always was, and what is shown is the last
of those readings - so it can be hours old, and its age says so. Only the numbers are kept, with the
time they were read: which window, how much is used, its length and its reset time. No account,
plan or credit. (The advanced edition's two reset actions read usage on their own while one of their
rules waits, and one of them keeps how many reset credits you have; its usage meter, when you turn it on,
reads usage on its own at the spacing you choose, and its newest reading is what this line and the icon's
tooltip then show, with a notice near the limit you set; [EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md) says so for each.)

<img src="images/settings-window.png" alt="The Continuation message section of the Dashboard's Settings page: the continuation language, the four message styles with Standard selected, and a Preview of the message sent for a usage limit" width="680">

While the watcher runs it also puts an icon in the notification area. It belongs to the watcher
process itself, so it appears when one starts and goes when it stops. Its mark alone says what the
watcher is doing - it wears no badge - so it is the same picture as the Dashboard's taskbar
button. Its tooltip says whether recovery is paused, how many recoveries
are waiting, how many are running in Codex and how long until the next check - or, until you have
seen it, that a recovery failed.

From v0.6.11 every place that shows the version also names the Advanced edition when it is the one
installed, in the interface language: the version at the foot of the Dashboard, the Version row on
its Diagnostics page and the heading of the panel in Codex, each with the edition after the version
in smaller grey text (`v0.6.11` *Advanced*). The icon's tooltip names it after the product's name.
From v0.6.14 the Standard edition shows the version alone in each of those places, and the product's
name alone in the tooltip. Its name appears only where editions are told apart: where you choose one,
as in *Install another version...*, and where the installer and Diagnostics say that Codex still has
the other edition's copy of the plugin. An Advanced installation whose own part could not be loaded
runs as the Standard edition and says *Advanced - not loaded* there instead.

The icon moves, in the mark it already has. While the watcher watches, the head - the bright dot at
the end of the ring - breathes, dimming toward the icon's deep blue and back every 4.4 seconds, and
after three breaths it sweeps along the ring's white stroke and back, clockwise, at full
brightness: 3.52 seconds out, a moment at the far end, 3.52 seconds back and 1.54 at home. It never
breathes while it travels, and it never crosses the gap at the top of the ring. While a recovery is
in progress it sweeps out and back over and over, twice as quickly - once every 3.96 seconds -
without breathing. Paused, it is grey and still; when something needs you it turns amber and
breathes slowly in its place, every 5.6 seconds, for as long as it lasts; after a recovery fails it
turns red and sweeps out and back like a recovery, twice as quickly - once every 1.98 seconds -
blinking as it goes, every 1.2 seconds, and stays red until you have seen it: click the icon to open the popup, or bring the Dashboard to the
front. A recovery that starts afterwards clears it as well. Nothing moves under Reduce motion, Windows' animation setting, High Contrast or battery
saver, while the session is locked, or while Windows keeps the icon in the overflow flyout and the flyout is closed,
where nobody would see it; it moves while you have the flyout open. While the Dashboard is open, its taskbar button moves the same way and
stops for the same reasons.

<img src="images/status-light.png" alt="The status light breathing on a card: a cyan dot that dims to about two thirds of its colour and comes back over 4.4 seconds, with a soft glow that grows out from under it as it brightens and is gone at the bottom of the breath" width="112">

While the watcher is watching, the light breathes: one cycle every 4.4 seconds, the dot dimming to
62% of its colour and back along a cosine, with a glow that rides that brightness and reaches 0.6 of
the dot's radius past its edge. It is the same light in the window, in the notification-area popup,
in the panel in Codex and on the notification card. A recovery in progress breathes it every 2.8
seconds, attention every 5.6 and a failure every 1.2; waiting breathes as monitoring does and checking holds it lit and still; Reduce motion, Windows' animation setting and
High Contrast hold it still too.

<img src="images/icon-motion.png" alt="The notification-area icon's motion, drawn from the icon's own frames, on a light taskbar.

A single click on the icon opens a small popup beside it, and another click closes it: the
watcher's state, how many tasks are waiting and recovering, the next check, up to three waiting
tasks, each with its own **Auto-resume** switch bound to that task's exact interruption and conversation,
**Pause recovery** or **Resume recovery**, and **Open Dashboard**. A click anywhere else, or Esc,
closes it too. The popup runs inside the watcher process, on the icon's own thread, and goes
through the same control layer as every other surface; nothing in it can send a continuation.
The right-click menu is what it was: it opens the Dashboard, pauses or resumes recovery, and
stops the watcher; it is drawn dark while the popup is. The popup and the menu take up a new
language or theme the next time they open, without restarting the watcher. The countdown only means the watcher looks again — nothing is sent because it
reaches zero. The icon is on by default and can be switched off on the Settings page.

Every window, the popup, the notifications and the panel inside Codex follow the interface
language. The same popup in Korean, Japanese, Simplified Chinese and German:

## Please read this limitation first

This tool can only auto-resume a thread that the Windows ChatGPT/Codex desktop app **currently has
loaded**.

After the app restarts, a target thread is `notLoaded`. There is **no verified, supported way to wake an
unloaded thread programmatically**. When this was measured, a message queued for an unloaded thread
stayed in the queue and was not delivered as a conversation turn during the 90 seconds the thread
stayed unloaded; see
[`docs/evidence/unloaded-thread-delivery.json`](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/blob/main/docs/evidence/unloaded-thread-delivery.json).
Codex may still deliver such a message later, when the thread next loads. So this tool queues only
for a thread it has just confirmed is loaded, and asks Codex to withdraw its own queued message if the
thread is reported unloaded before the message arrives. If Codex does not confirm the withdrawal, the
message may stay queued; the record is then marked `submission_unknown` and is never resent.

So an unloaded thread is resumed **only after you open that conversation in the ChatGPT app yourself**.
Until then the watcher simply waits in its `waiting_for_loaded_thread` state, which the window and
the Codex panel report as the public code `waiting_thread` and show as "waiting for the
conversation", and which the command line prints beside the state. It
will not use GUI automation, will not force the conversation open, and will not queue a message on
the off chance.

A conversation that is open in another Codex session - a terminal's Codex TUI or the VS Code extension - is
a different case. The Codex app does not hold it, but it is not unloaded either: another session has it
open. It waits with a reason of its own, "Open in another Codex session (a terminal or VS Code); it
continues once the Codex app holds it.", and nothing is sent to it. It continues once the Codex app holds
the conversation.

This is not fully unattended auto-resume across app restarts, and this guide will not pretend otherwise.

## Project direction

> Keep the recovery engine small, local, conservative, and fail-closed. Spend complexity on making it
> easy to install and control, not on making the runtime do more.

The recovery engine is deliberately one small watcher. Everything else exists to see and
control it: a standalone Windows window — a settings window up to v0.5.7, a Dashboard from
v0.6.0 — a settings panel inside Codex over MCP, the command line, the watcher's own
notification-area icon and the popup it opens, and Windows notifications. None of those can
recover anything by itself, and the watcher keeps running whether or not any of them is open.

What the project still avoids: a separate tray process, a management web UI, a supervisor process, a
Windows service, a second recovery engine, and a second state database. The notification-area icon and
its popup are not an exception: the watcher owns both, so they cannot show a watcher that is not
there, and everything their menus, buttons and switches offer goes through the same control layer
as the other surfaces.

**Two editions.** From v0.6.11 the product is built and released as two editions, from one repository
and with one version. The **standard** edition is the one this guide describes: it keeps every one of
the project's standards - what [Safety model](#safety-model) and [Privacy](#privacy) promise among
them - and what it gains keeps them too, each addition off, or doing what the release before it did,
until you change it. The **advanced** edition is the standard one plus capabilities that break one of
those standards on purpose. Each says which it breaks, is off until you turn it on after reading
that, and turns itself off again when what you agreed to stops being true - unless you chose, on the
same page and after its own warning, to keep it on - which turns it on as well - and which notes what would
have turned it off instead.
One that needs another turns that one on with it, in the same confirmation and with both statements
shown, and turning the needed one off turns off first what needs it.
You turn one on in the Dashboard, on the page that edition adds, **Advanced features**, and nowhere
else; from v0.6.14 that page can also send one waiting recovery now, while Send now is on, and have a
reset credit used, or a message of your own sent, at a usage reset you pick, each shown on Pending
under Scheduled until it acts. Their code is left
out of the standard edition's archive, and `build/edition_audit.py` proves from the archive's own
bytes, in every release build, that none of it is there. An installation updates within its edition;
moving to the other is a reinstall. The [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) says what each has, and what is still
to come. [EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md) says what each edition is and what each capability does, and
[STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md) lists every standard by its id, with how it is held.

The advanced edition's state is the one exception to *a second state database*: which capability is
on, what each has spent and what it did, the choices and the rules a person set for the capabilities
that have them, which capability took up which interruption, the samples of failures nothing
classified, the reset rules and - until it is sent - the words of a message written for a reset are kept in `config/advanced/advanced.sqlite`, apart from the watcher's own state, so nothing in the standard edition's database changes for it
(`advanced/tests/test_advanced_state.py`). It exists only in the advanced edition, and is made
there only when something in it is first turned on or changed; the standard edition never creates
it, and `Uninstall.cmd -Purge` removes it with the rest of `config\`.

## Features

- Recovers usage limits and clearly classified temporary failures, on separate policies. Never
  retries a failure it cannot classify.
- Tracks the exact thread UUID. Never `--last`, never a guessed thread.
- Waits for the real reset timestamp when one is available, instead of sleeping a fixed number of hours.
- Verifies the desktop app is running and the thread is genuinely loaded before sending anything.
- Never resumes the same interruption twice, including across a crash or a watcher restart.
- Durable pending state in SQLite that survives reboots.
- Handles several interrupted threads independently.
- Bounded retry backoff, a global kill switch, and per-thread control.
- Single-instance protection, optional per-user Windows autostart, and a conservative uninstall.
- Three ways to change a setting — the Dashboard from the Start Menu, a panel inside Codex, and
  the command line — all writing the same file through the same validator, so they cannot disagree.
- Sixteen interface languages (see [Languages](#languages)). It follows Windows unless you choose one.
- Light and dark themes: the Dashboard and the popup follow Windows, and the panel follows Codex,
  unless you choose one. High Contrast is always honoured.
- A continuation message you can shape: its language, a Minimal, Standard or Detailed style, or
  your own Custom words, with a Preview built by the same code the watcher sends with.
- A Dashboard that shows what the watcher is doing and why each task is waiting, with an
  Auto-resume switch per waiting task, and a popup from the notification-area icon with the
  same state, the next check and up to three waiting tasks.
- Windows notifications across the lifecycle: interruption detected, recovery starting, how it
  turned out, and when it stops for good. Each one has its own check box under one switch for
  them all, and the interruption notification can cancel that recovery or open the Dashboard.

## How it works

```
usage limit reached
  -> watcher reads Codex's local history (read-only) and sees usageLimitExceeded
  -> records the exact thread UUID in its own SQLite state
  -> waits until the reset timestamp
  -> checks the ChatGPT app is running and the thread is loaded
  -> re-checks live usage availability
  -> codex queue --thread <UUID> --message "<continuation>"
  -> the same thread continues the original work
```

What the continuation says depends on two settings: **Continuation language**, which by default
follows the interface language, and **Message style**. *Standard*, the default, says why the task
stopped and asks Codex to retry ("The task was interrupted because the usage limit was reached.
Please retry."); *Minimal* only asks it to retry; *Detailed* also asks it to check the existing
conversation and the current state of the work and to carry on without repeating what is already
done; *Custom* sends your own words. Up to v0.6.2 it was one fixed English sentence per kind of
interruption. The watcher adds one line after the message so it can recognise the exact turn it
starts. No style changes what is recovered; see [The continuation message](#the-continuation-message).

Loaded state is determined from the Windows Restart Manager: the app's own `codex.exe` engine holds the
thread's writer lock file open for exactly as long as the thread is loaded. The tool only reads that
ownership information. It never acquires a lock on the app's file.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11.
- The official Windows ChatGPT/Codex desktop app, running, with its engine at
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\bin\<hash>\codex.exe`.
- The engine is located automatically, and no version is trusted by its version string alone:
  whichever one is found, before a Codex update or after one, is accepted only if `codex queue`
  still offers `--thread` and `--message`. `status`/`doctor` then name it with one of three words
  that all send alike - *verified*, where a real recovery on that exact version confirmed it; *checked* (from
  v0.6.7), where the maintainer's own checks passed on that exact version and nothing confirmed
  more; *compatible*, where the compatibility data makes no claim about it. A local check that
  fails on a version the data checked or verified reads as *failed here* - the cause is then most
  likely this computer rather than that version - and it sends nothing, exactly as *incompatible*
  does. Anything that cannot prove that interface is refused rather than guessed at.
- A Codex update can start its engine from another `bin\<hash>` folder. The watcher then looks for
  the engine again, every check included: when the file it found is gone or replaced, and when the
  app runs its Codex server from another official build while that file is still there. It looks
  at once for each such change. If that build then fails its checks - as it can while the update is
  still writing it - the watcher tries again after a minute, then twice as long each time, up to
  every 15 minutes: not on every check, and with no restart needed once the build passes.
- Where more than one build passes those checks - an update can leave the old one beside the new -
  the one the ChatGPT app is running as its Codex server is the one driven. If that is not exactly
  one of them, none is chosen and recoveries wait until `--codex-exe` or the `codex_exe` setting
  names one. An engine named that way is always used as named.
- Your own machine can say something about a version too.
  [codex-compat-reporter](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-compat-reporter) is a separate,
  public tool that turns this installation's own records into one report — counts, states and
  times, no conversation text and no identifiers — which you read before you send it. It reaches
  GitHub only when you open the pull request yourself, and
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#sending-a-compatibility-report) says how that pull request is
  checked and filed: with no step by the maintainer, usually within minutes, after which the pull
  request is closed with one comment that says where the report went, or why it waits. Reports from other people are kept apart from this project's own evidence and carry a
  grade of their own, *reported*, which stands beside those words and never becomes one of them.
  Nothing can prove that a report was not written by hand on the machine that sent it, so a report
  never moves a version up the ladder, and a version whose own evidence says nothing stays
  *compatible* however many reports arrive.

  From v0.6.10 the Dashboard's Diagnostics page shows them in one muted line directly under *Codex
  version* - *Reported by others: worked 3 · failed 1 · neither 1* - and `doctor` and `compat`
  print the same counts. They count reports, one per GitHub name per Codex version, not machines.
  A report counts as *worked* when at least one record it delivered ended recovered, as *failed*
  when at least one ended in a failed recovery, and as *neither* when no delivered record ended
  either way, which includes a report that delivered nothing. A report whose records say both is
  counted in each, and the line then adds *counted in both* and how many, so worked, failed and
  neither, less those, add up to the reports. Only reports filed in this repository count, and
  only for your exact version: *none yet* means none is filed for it, and a check that cannot
  vouch for the version shows *-* there, as it does for the version itself. The counts arrive with
  each release, in a file of their own beside the compatibility data - no request fetches them, so
  a report filed later waits for the next release. They change nothing: no capability's state, no
  check and nothing the watcher sends moves with them, and Codex is never handed them - the
  compatibility card in the Codex panel points to the Dashboard instead.

**Python is not required by either install route** — the installation brings its own runtime
(Python 3.13.15), and the plugin's setup script is PowerShell. Python 3.12 or newer is needed only if
you run the engine from a source checkout; see [Testing](#testing) for the versions CI runs.

## What is recovered, and what is not

Automatically recovered:

| Failure | Policy |
| --- | --- |
| Usage limit (`usageLimitExceeded`) | Waits for the real reset timestamp, then re-checks live usage |
| Connection failure (`httpConnectionFailed`) | Bounded backoff |
| Timeout (HTTP 408/425) | Bounded backoff |
| Transient rate limit (HTTP 429, `rateLimitExceeded`, and `responseTooManyFailedAttempts` carrying a 429) | Bounded backoff, with a first wait of at least a minute |
| Server error (HTTP 5xx, `serverOverloaded`, `internalServerError`) | Bounded backoff |
| Stream disconnection (`responseStreamDisconnected`, `responseStreamConnectionFailed`) | Bounded backoff |

Never recovered — these need a person, and retrying only wastes attempts:

user cancellation · permission · approval required · content policy · invalid request ·
context length exceeded · permanent authentication (401/403, `unauthorized`) · `badRequest` ·
`sandboxError` · `responseTooManyFailedAttempts` with any status but 429 · **anything unrecognised**.

A conversation that another Codex session holds - a terminal's TUI or the VS Code extension - is not a
failure to recover: it waits, with a reason of its own, until the Codex app holds it, and nothing is
sent to it.

Codex itself retries a failed request a few times before a turn fails.

A turn that fails because the conversation is longer than its model's context window is never retried
by the standard edition.
Codex compacts on its own first; when a turn still fails, run `/compact` in Codex yourself and continue.
This program never sends `/compact`: a queued "/compact" reaches Codex as plain text.

Classification is structural: it reads the `codexErrorInfo` variant Codex writes, then an HTTP status
carried by that variant. Message text is consulted only when there is no structured code at all, and
only for transport failures that have none. A structured code is never overridden by message text.

Recovery is bounded three times over: at most 4 attempts per interruption, it stops after 3
consecutive recoveries that produced no visible progress, and one task receives at most 6
continuations in total across every failure of it — a failure of our own recovery turn continues that
same chain instead of starting a fresh budget. The per-task limit accepts 1 to 10 and nothing outside
it. If you carry on in that conversation yourself, the old interruption is dropped rather than
replayed on top of your work.

## Managing it from Codex

Once it is installed, either route gives you the same skill. Just ask, in the app:

> Set up auto resume

and afterwards "show auto resume status", "show pending auto resumes", "open auto resume
settings", "turn auto resume off" and "turn auto resume back on", "cancel auto resume for this
task", "show auto resume statistics", "show the timeline for that recovery", "try that recovery
now", "give that recovery its attempts back", "start the watcher", "clear auto resume history",
"preview the auto resume message", "uninstall auto resume".

"Preview the auto resume message" uses `preview_recovery_message`, one of the plugin's 20 tools. It
is read-only: it shows the exact text the watcher would send for one kind of interruption, under the
current language and style or under ones named for the preview alone, and it saves nothing and sends
nothing. Codex can change the interface language, the continuation language, the message style,
including switching it to Custom, and the theme, but it cannot write a Custom message: that text is sent into your
conversations automatically, so it is written only in the Dashboard, under Settings >
Continuation message. Nor can it change what moves: Reduce motion and, from v0.6.10, the Design
are set in the Dashboard too. The panel in Codex draws in both.

Nothing that turns automation down is marked as needing your confirmation: pausing recovery, turning
it off for one conversation, asking for a re-check, postponing a recovery. Previewing the message is read-only. Turning it back on, changing a setting, starting
the watcher, cancelling a recovery, giving a recovery its attempts back, letting a recovery that waits
for you continue and clearing the history are all marked with MCP's `destructiveHint` to request approval. Codex and your approval settings
decide whether to show a prompt; this project's tests check the annotations, and actual
Codex approval behavior has not been observed for this release.

The plugin is a thin front end over the same validated control layer the command line and the Start
Menu window use: its tools call that layer directly, and the skill falls back to the commands below
when the tools are not available. It adds no second engine and no background service. It keeps its
state in `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume\`, outside the plugin directory, so updating or removing
the plugin never loses a pending resume. The watcher keeps running when the Codex app is closed, and
starts again at Windows sign-in.

See [docs/PLUGIN.md](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN.md) for the layout, exactly what the setup script will and will
not do, the update and removal lifecycle, and why the usage-limit notice does **not** get a checkbox.

### The panel beside the chat

The settings panel in Codex can sit beside a conversation, in the Codex app's right side panel, as well
as in the conversation itself.

- **Open beside the chat.** Where Codex can show it there, the panel's bottom bar starts with *Open
  beside the chat*, which asks Codex to move the panel to the right side panel and calls no tool. If
  Codex keeps it in the conversation, the button goes for that page and the bar says *Codex kept the
  panel here.*
- **A tab of the side panel.** The panel's tool, *Open Auto Resume settings*, offers itself to a
  conversation's side panel: a Codex app that lists plugins' tools shows it under New tab > More
  tools....
- **Read again on return.** Beside the chat, the panel reads its state again when you come back to it,
  at most once every 15 seconds and never while something is being changed there, and leaves the
  keyboard on the control it was on. It runs no timer.

Measurements MP1 to MP3, that the Codex app shows the panel there as it should, passed on
`codex-cli 0.162` and `codex-cli 0.163` ([docs/LIVE_ACCEPTANCE.md](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/blob/main/docs/LIVE_ACCEPTANCE.md)).

> There is one installation, and both routes converge on it. If you also run a source checkout,
> keep only one: separate state means two watchers, and two watchers could resume the same task
> twice. Setup detects that and refuses rather than creating the second one.

## Running it from source

For development, or if you would rather run it yourself. This is not a third way to install the
product — it is the engine on its own, with no settings window, no panel and no bundled runtime,
and it needs **Python 3.12 or newer** on your PATH (CI runs it on 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows.git
```

```bash
cd codex-auto-resume-windows
```

There is nothing to build. Verify your environment first:

```bash
python src/auto_resume.py doctor
```

`doctor` queues no message and opens none of Codex's files for writing; the only things it may
create are this tool's own state and log folders, the ownership marker in each, and its log
file, if they are missing. It reports the discovered engine, whether the app is paired, whether
the Restart Manager probe works, and whether the local history is readable.

## Quick start

```bash
python src/auto_resume.py doctor
```

```bash
python src/auto_resume.py enable
```

```bash
python src/auto_resume.py run
```

`run` stays in the foreground and polls. Leave it running in a terminal while you work.

Check what it is doing:

```bash
python src/auto_resume.py status
```

```bash
python src/auto_resume.py pending
```

```bash
python src/auto_resume.py logs
```

Stop it:

```bash
python src/auto_resume.py disable
```

```bash
python src/auto_resume.py stop
```

`disable` is the kill switch: it immediately prevents any further resume while keeping your pending
records. `stop` asks a running watcher process to exit.

## Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `doctor` | Environment check that queues nothing: engine, app pairing, Restart Manager, history. |
| `enable [thread-id]` | Turn auto-resume on globally, or for one thread. |
| `disable [thread-id]` | Kill switch: stop all automatic resumes, or just one thread. |
| `status` | Enablement, watcher state, autostart, engine, and record counts. |
| `pending` | Interruptions waiting to resume (`--all`, `--json`). |
| `cancel <thread-id>` | Cancel pending resumes for one thread and disable it. |
| `logs` | Recent log lines (`-n N`). |
| `run` | Run the watcher in the foreground (`--once`, `--poll N`). |
| `stop` | Ask a running watcher to exit. |
| `install` | Create the owned directories and state (`--startup`). |
| `uninstall` | Remove autostart and owned state/logs (`--keep-logs`, `--keep-state`). |
| `diagnostics` | Write one redacted diagnostics file, to read before you share it (`--out`). |
| `downgrade-state --to 4` | Rewrite the state file for a v0.6.11 to v0.6.14 release or the v0.6.15 hotfix; stop the watcher first, or use `--stop-watcher` as below. The conversion is the same as `--to 3`'s; *Install another version...* uses it. |
| `downgrade-state --to 3` | Rewrite the state file for a v0.6.0 to v0.6.10 release; stop the watcher first. A continuation that may already have gone out is marked final, and a conversation that waited for you to say so, or whose continuation Codex may still deliver, is switched off. With `--stop-watcher` it asks the watcher to stop instead, waits up to a minute and never kills it, and says what it did on one line; *Install another version...* uses it. |
| `downgrade-state --to 2` | Rewrite the state file for a v0.5 release; stop the watcher first. |
| `compat` | What the Codex Compatibility Registry says about this Codex, from the watcher's last report (`--live` to check now and write nothing, `--json`, `--import FILE` to validate a data file and keep it only if it passes). |

Global options: `--home` (where this tool keeps its own state), `--codex-exe`, `--codex-home`, `--quiet`.

By default, failures up to 6 hours old at the moment you run `enable` are still eligible. Change it with
`enable --lookback-hours N`.

## The notification

When the watcher records an interruption, it shows one notification naming the task. From
v0.6.5 it appears as a card in the product's own design beside the notification area, with the
same words and the same buttons as Windows' notification, and the same notification is added to
Windows' notification center silently once the card has been seen. Windows' own notification is
shown instead whenever a card must not be: with **Show notifications as a card beside the
notification area** off (Settings > General > Windows), with Do not disturb or Focus on, over a
full-screen app, on a locked or remote session, while a screen reader runs, or when the
notification-area icon is off.

```
Payment retry refactor
Codex usage limit reached. This task will resume at 05:56.
example-project  ·  Conversation: 0a1b2c3d-0109-7000-8000-000000000109
                         [Don't resume]   [Open Dashboard]
```

The first line is the conversation title, or the project, or the working directory's name, or
"Codex task". The **exact thread UUID is always shown**: titles repeat, identity must not. A
temporary failure names what kind it was — "Network problem · Codex was temporarily interrupted.
Retrying automatically." — with a **Don't retry** button instead.

Three lines, not four: Windows renders at most three and drops the rest, so the reason comes
before the identifiers rather than after them.

Those names are for display only. Recovery never resolves a thread by title, project or recency.

Doing nothing resumes — that is the default. **Don't resume** / **Don't retry** cancels the
auto-resume for that one interruption and whatever continues it, and nothing else. **Open
Dashboard** opens the Dashboard on its Pending page and does nothing more.

From v0.6.16 a click on the notification itself - the card's face, or the body of Windows' own
notification - opens the Dashboard on the page the notification is about: the page its **Open
Dashboard** button opens, or, for a notification without that button, Pending while a continuation is
being sent, History once it has ended, Settings for the power action's, and otherwise the Overview. The card then goes, as a click always made it go; a right
click only puts it away, and the buttons do what they always did.

A notification goes away by itself after a while. **Keep on screen until clicked**, under Settings >
General > Notifications, lists each kind of notification - an interruption detected, a recovery
starting, resumed, could not resume, stopped trying, cancelled, a conversation that needs you, tasks
waiting after a long sleep, the watcher's memory, and the power action after usage-limit recoveries;
the advanced edition adds its usage meter's warning, each of its three notices about a stop near a
limit and its weekly update check's offer of a newer version - and a kind ticked there stays on screen until
you click it or a newer notification needs its place (at most three cards stack, and the oldest is pushed
out): the card stays beside the notification area, and Windows' own notification stays as a
reminder until you close it, with a button to close it where it has none. None is ticked at first.

From v0.6.11 a conversation can ask more of you first (see
[Quiet hours and how a conversation resumes](#quiet-hours-and-how-a-conversation-resumes)), and the
notification then says so instead of promising a resume: an interruption that waits for you says it
waits for you to let it continue, from the Dashboard, and one in a conversation that only notifies
says nothing is resumed automatically. A conversation with a chance to object gets one more
notification, just before its continuation would be sent: "Continuing at 14:07 unless you stop it",
with the same two buttons. Neither button can ever make anything be sent.

This is the only point where a control can be offered at the time it matters. By the time a usage
limit appears in the Codex app, that turn has already failed, so nothing can be added to the app's
own usage-limit notice; the watcher, however, is running. See [docs/PLUGIN.md](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/blob/main/docs/PLUGIN.md) for
why the notice itself cannot get a checkbox.

A related choice is offered in two more places, each bound to the exact interruption and
conversation it is shown beside: an **Auto-resume** switch on each task in the notification-area popup, and the
**Auto-resume** column on the Dashboard's Pending page. Rather than cancelling one interruption,
that switch turns automatic recovery off for the task's conversation until it is switched
back on. A click that reaches a task which has since finished, disappeared or turned out to belong
to a different conversation is refused and changes nothing. None of the three sends anything: they
change whether the watcher may, and the watcher still checks everything before it does.

Details worth knowing:

- The buttons need a handler, so `install` registers a per-user `codex-auto-resume:` URL protocol
  under `HKCU\Software\Classes`. `uninstall` removes it again, and only when it points at this
  installation.
- That protocol accepts exactly two actions: cancelling one resume, and opening one page of the
  Dashboard from a fixed list. A hostile or mistyped URI can only ever *stop* a resume or open a
  window, never cause one, and the interruption id must match a real record.
- The notification shows labels, a local time and the thread UUID — never prompt text, error text,
  or account data. The kind of interruption is the product's own label for the classified
  category, not the error text. Display names come from `threads.name` only; `title`, `preview`
  and `first_user_message` hold the raw first prompt on this schema and are never read.
- Notifications are in the interface language.
- It is best effort. If it cannot be shown, the resume still happens exactly as it would have.
- They are attributed to **Codex Auto Resume**, with this project's own icon, not to PowerShell
  or Python. That takes two
  registrations, not one: an AppUserModelID under `HKCU\Software\Classes\AppUserModelId` supplies
  the name and icon, and a Start Menu shortcut carrying the same id is what makes Windows draw
  the toast at all. Without the shortcut the platform accepts the notification, logs it, and
  files it in the notification centre without ever showing it. That was measured, not assumed.

Three more notifications follow the first: recovery starting, how it turned out, and recovery
stopping for good. Each is raised once, from the state change itself, so what the notification
says and what the record holds can never disagree. An uncertain submission is reported as
uncertain rather than as a failure that will be retried, because it is the one outcome that is
deliberately never resent.

Turn any of them off in the Dashboard, or from Codex, or with `update_settings`. Doing so
changes nothing about whether a task is recovered.

### When a conversation needs you

From v0.6.11 the watcher can also tell you about a conversation it will never resume, because only
you can move it on. This is off by default: turn on **When a conversation needs you** under
Settings > General > Notifications. Its kinds, its time and its sound stand under it, and can be changed
while it is on. Then:

- A failure that is never retried raises one notification with its kind in a word and one next
  step: the request was refused or the conversation is too long ("Request refused · Conversation too
  long? Compact it or start a new one in Codex."), a content policy stopped the turn, Codex needs you
  to sign in again, or Codex gave up on the turn.
  One check box per kind picks which of the four are told. A turn you stopped yourself is never told.
- With **When a turn has not moved for** set to a time from 10 minutes to 2 hours, or one of your
  own, a conversation whose latest turn is still in progress and has recorded nothing new for that
  long raises one too:
  "Nothing new in this turn for 20 minutes. Look at it in Codex." That is all it
  knows. It reads only the turn's own columns and when its newest item was recorded, never what any
  item says, so it never says why; the turn may simply still be working.

Each is told once, however often the watcher looks and across restarts, only for a conversation
whose automatic recovery is on and while recovery is not paused, and never for a failure more than
a week old. Nothing is resumed, sent or recorded as a recovery for any of them. The notification's
one button, **Open Dashboard**, opens the Dashboard's Settings page, which is where a kind is
switched off; the notification itself changes no setting. **Play a sound for these** gives these
notifications Windows' reminder sound. They are then always Windows' own notification, even with
the card on, because the card makes no sound, and Do not disturb holds them back as it holds back
any notification. Without it they make no sound.

## Settings

Everything configurable lives in one place and is reachable three ways:

- **Start Menu → Codex Auto Resume** — the Dashboard's Settings page. It works with Codex
  closed, the plugin disabled, no network, no sign-in and no system Python, because
  configuration matters most exactly when the thing it configures is unavailable.
- **Inside Codex** — ask to open auto resume settings and a panel appears in the conversation.
- **The command line** — for scripting and for repair.

All three write the same file through the same validator, so a value set in one is the value the
others show. Nothing needs hand-editing: a hand-written settings file is validated on read, so a
bad value is replaced by the safe default rather than half-applied.

The Settings page is split into five sections:

| Section | What is in it |
| --- | --- |
| General | Interface language, starting at Windows sign-in, the notification-area icon, from v0.6.11 keeping this PC awake while a task waits, the watcher's memory guard and a status file for other tools, and which notifications appear - from v0.6.11 also when a conversation needs you |
| Automatic recovery | Which classified kinds of interruption are recovered, one check box each, and from v0.6.11 Observe only |
| Continuation message | The language and style of the message sent to Codex, your own Custom message, and a Preview of the exact text |
| Appearance | The theme - Use system setting, Light or Dark - the panel's Theme in Codex, the Design - Soft, Classic (v0.6.2) or Plain - and Reduce motion |
| Advanced | Attempts per interruption, when to give up after recoveries that produce nothing, continuations per task, retry timing, and from v0.6.11 quiet hours, how a conversation resumes, what a conversation seen for the first time gets, which projects may resume, the Custom retry waits and jitter, a time ceiling, the task-changed and context-cost guards, what waits after a long sleep, and waiting for an internet connection - and from v0.6.16 (first published as v0.6.15-beta) the [Codex homes](#several-codex-homes) it watches |

Every kind of interruption the watcher recovers has a check box, ticked by default. From v0.6.3 to
v0.6.9 there was one more, **Sign-in service failures**, for a sign-in service that is temporarily
unavailable (`auth_service_transient`), and this guide said that kind had been recovered with no way to
turn it off up to v0.6.2. It never was: no error Codex records was ever classified as that kind, so the
check box could change nothing. From v0.6.10 it is gone, with its Custom message; the kind comes back
only when a real Codex error is seen to carry it.

A switch turns on or off something that runs - notifications, the notification-area icon, Reduce
motion, starting at sign-in, automatic recovery for one conversation - and a check box picks which
items of a list apply: the kinds of interruption above, and which notifications appear. A setting is
the same kind in the Dashboard and in the panel.

You cannot switch off a safety property, because none of them is a setting. There is no option
that retries an unclassified failure, resolves a conversation by title, resends an uncertain
submission or forces a send — by design, not by omission.

### Values of your own: Custom... and Unlimited

From v0.6.11 every drop-down of a value - a wait, a time of day, the days quiet hours start on, a
number of hours, megabytes or tokens - ends in **Custom...**, in the Dashboard and in the panel in
Codex alike. It takes a value of your own besides the list, and says the range it may be in:

| Setting | Custom... takes |
| --- | --- |
| Quiet hours from, Quiet hours until | any minute of the day, 00:00 to 23:59 |
| Quiet hours on | any days you tick, Monday to Sunday |
| Custom timing: first wait | 5 seconds to 2 hours |
| Custom timing: second to fifth wait | 15 minutes to 6 hours, in whole minutes |
| Stop a task that keeps failing after | 15 minutes to 7 days, in whole minutes |
| Tokens a conversation has used (Hold above) | 10,000 to 10,000,000, in whole thousands |
| When a turn has not moved for | 5 minutes to 7 days, in whole minutes |
| Ask me after a sleep longer than | 5 minutes to 7 days, in whole minutes |
| Keep it awake for at most | 15 minutes to 7 days, in whole minutes - or **Unlimited** |
| Too much memory is more than | 128 to 16384 MB |

In the Dashboard, Custom... opens a small dialog - a number and its unit, the hour and the minute, or
the seven days - and **Use this value** asks the settings' own validator before the drop-down shows
the value; one it does not take is said so in the dialog, with the range, and nothing changes. In the
panel the same fields open under the setting, and Save is answered by the same validator, as every
other change is. A value is kept in its shortest exact form - 60 minutes is kept as 1 hour, and days
that one of the choices names are that choice - so no two stored values mean the same thing.

**Period** on the Statistics page - Last 7 days, Last 30 days, All time - has no Custom...: it only says
how far back that page counts, it is not a setting, and nothing of it is kept, so the window opens at
Last 7 days each time.

**Unlimited** is there only where the limit is yours alone: how long this PC is kept awake while a task
waits, which it then is for as long as any task waits - and let go, as always, when none does, when
recovery is paused and when the watcher stops. Every other such list already starts with **Off**,
which is no limit, and a second word for it would be two ways to one result. No bound that keeps
recovery safe has Unlimited or a value past it: a retry wait stays between its list's first and last,
the attempt budgets stay numbers in their ranges, and the watcher's own floor - one continuation per
conversation every 15 minutes, five in any 24 hours - is not a setting at all.

A settings file written before still loads as it was. A version before this one reads a value of your
own as that setting's default.

### Quiet hours and how a conversation resumes

From v0.6.11 two more settings, under Advanced, can hold a recovery back. Both are off by default,
where the watcher behaves as it always did, and neither can make anything be sent sooner or skip a
check.

**Quiet hours** - from, until, and on which days they start, each a choice or, with Custom..., any
minute and any days - make a recovery that falls due in them wait until they end. Hours that run past midnight belong to the day they start on, and the times are
your clock's, across a change to or from summer time. Time spent in quiet hours does not count toward
giving up on a usage limit that never lifts. *Why it is waiting* says "Quiet hours until 08:00".

**Before resuming a conversation** says how much a conversation without a choice of its own asks
first, for interruptions detected from then on; a task's row menu chooses for its conversation alone:

| Choice | What happens |
| --- | --- |
| Resume automatically | As always: every check, then the continuation. The default. |
| After a chance to object | When everything else would let the continuation go, a notification says when it will, and it goes only once **Time to object** - 1 to 60 minutes, 5 by default - has passed. Don't resume stops it. Postponing a task before its window opens only holds it back - the window still opens after - and one postponed while its window is open goes at the time you chose; **Don't postpone** brings it back to the window's time, never sooner. |
| Ask me first | Nothing is sent until you choose **Let it continue** on its row, in the Dashboard or the popup. |
| Only notify me | The same, and the notification says nothing is resumed automatically. |

Choosing Ask me first or Only notify me for a conversation also holds what it has waiting. Choosing a
way that asks less lets nothing go that already waits for you: each such task still needs its own
**Let it continue**. A postponement or quiet hours still apply after it.

### Observe only, and which conversations and projects resume

From v0.6.11 three more settings can hold recovery back. Each is off by default, where the watcher
behaves as it always did, and none can make anything be sent sooner or skip a check.

**Observe only**, under Automatic recovery, lets the watcher do everything but send. Every check still
runs, and a recovery that would have been sent is shown as such: its row in Pending and History says
"would have been sent" and when, *Why it is waiting* says every check but Observe only passed, and its
timeline records it once each time it comes to that. The Overview says observe only where it says
recovery is on, and so does the popup. Nothing is claimed and nothing is sent: the watcher refuses on
the setting, and the recovery state it keeps has a switch of its own, written from the setting, that
refuses every send by itself. A continuation already in Codex's queue when it is turned on is taken
back, as a Pause takes it; should Codex have started it all the same, its timeline says it ran
although Observe only was on - never that recovery was paused. Turn it off to let recovery send again.

**A conversation seen for the first time**, under Advanced, is resumed like the others by default.
**Only notify me** gives a conversation this product has never seen that choice as its own when its
first interruption is detected, so nothing is sent for it until you let a task continue or change how
it resumes from its task's row. A conversation already seen keeps what it had.

**Projects that may resume**, under Advanced, is every project by default. **Only projects let resume**
lets a task resume without you only when its project was set with **Let this project resume** on a
task's row; **Every project but those held** lets every project resume but those set with **Hold this
project for me**. Hold this project for me under the default also switches to the second. A task of any
other project - or of one whose project cannot be read - waits for you when it is detected, as Only
notify me does, and is never dropped: **Let it continue** lets it go. Holding a project from a row also
holds what that project has waiting; letting one resume lets nothing go that already waits for you.
A project is the one Codex files the conversation under, or else the folder it works in, and only a
64-digit digest of it is kept in the settings: never a name or a path. At the default Codex's project
is not even read for this.

### Custom waits, a time ceiling and two guards

From v0.6.11 Advanced has four more things. Each is off, or unused, by default, and then the watcher
waits and sends exactly as it always did. None can send anything sooner or skip a check: each can only
make a recovery wait longer, stop sooner or wait for you.

**Retry timing** gains **Custom**: five waits you pick from lists - or, with Custom..., of your own
within each list's range - for a task that fails with a temporary error. The first comes before the task's first continuation, the second after a continuation
of the same task failed again, and so on, and the fifth is used for every attempt after it. The first
may be as short as 5 seconds; each later one starts at 15 minutes, which is the watcher's own floor
and not a setting - whatever is chosen, one conversation gets a continuation at most every 15 minutes
and at most five times in any 24 hours. A rate limit's first wait is still at least a minute, and where
Codex's structured error names a wait (a Retry-After) the first wait is never shorter than that; no
Codex build has been seen to write one. A line under the waits says what the chosen timing comes to if
each continuation fails at once - for Normal, 5 seconds and then about 15 minutes each - and the panel
in Codex says the same. **Add up to a fifth to each wait** (jitter) lengthens every wait of a temporary
failure by a random amount of up to a fifth, and never shortens one.

**Stop a task that keeps failing after** is off by default. From 1 to 24 hours - or a time of your own
from 15 minutes to 7 days - it stops a task whose
temporary failures have gone on for longer than that, measured from its first failure to its latest
less the time it waited for anything but its own retries: time spent paused, postponed, in an
objection window, in quiet hours or waiting for the app never counts, while the retry waits and the
15 minutes between two continuations do. It stops the task the way
running out of attempts does - **Give attempts back** gives the time back too - and does not touch
usage limits.

**If the task changed while it waited** - the task-changed guard - compares, just before a
continuation is sent, the conversation's model and approval mode and the git branch or commit of its
folder with what they were when it stopped. The branch or commit is the folder's `.git/HEAD`, read as a
file; git is never run. **Hold it for me** keeps a task that changed waiting for you - **Let it
continue** lets it go, and only a further change holds it again - and **Resume, and tell me** sends it
and says on its notification that the task changed. A folder that could be read when the task stopped
and cannot be read now counts as changed, and a folder given as a network share path is not read at
all. Only a digest of the three is kept. It applies to interruptions detected after it is chosen.

**Tokens a conversation has used** - the context-cost guard - reads Codex's own count when an
interruption is detected, where Codex's list of conversations keeps one as a number. **Show them in
Pending** puts the count beside the task; **Hold above** 100,000 to 1,000,000 - or a count of your
own - also keeps a task whose
conversation has used more waiting for you from the start. Where Codex keeps no such count, the guard
does nothing. It applies to interruptions detected after it is chosen.

When **Attempts per interruption**, **Stop after this many turns without progress** or
**Continuations per task** is set above 8, 5 or 8, a notice under them says so, in the Dashboard and in
the panel: a task that keeps failing can then be continued many times, and every continuation uses
your Codex usage.

### Sleep, keeping this PC awake, and the internet

From v0.6.11 three more things, each off by default. Off, the watcher asks Windows nothing for them
and waits exactly as it always did; on, none of them sends anything, skips a check or makes a
recovery go sooner than its time.

**Ask me after a sleep longer than**, under Advanced - 30 minutes to 12 hours, or a time of your own -
holds, for you, every
waiting recovery that fell due while this PC slept for longer than that. One notification says how
long it slept and how many tasks wait, with one button, **Open Dashboard**, at Pending; each task's
**Let it continue** lets it go, and **Cancel** stops it. *Why it is waiting* says it fell due
while the PC slept. How long the PC slept is measured between two of the watcher's looks, from the
clock and from Windows' own count of the time the PC was awake, so a look that comes before Windows
says the PC has woken still sees the sleep. A task whose time had not come by the wake is not held.

**Keep this PC awake while a task waits**, under General > Windows - **On mains power only** or
**Always** - asks Windows not to let the PC sleep on its own while a task waits, for at most the hours
chosen under **Keep it awake for at most** (6 by default; a time of your own, or Unlimited) each time
tasks start waiting. It is a
request the watcher makes and takes back, the kind `powercfg /requests` lists: when nothing waits,
when the hours are up, when recovery is paused and when the watcher stops, and Windows ends it with
the watcher in any case. The display may still turn off, closing the lid or choosing Sleep still
sleeps the PC, and no setting of Windows is changed. On mains power only lets it sleep on battery as
usual. While it keeps the PC awake, the Overview says so and since when - first on the line under Waiting,
before the last usage reading, so the card has no line more; a line longer than the card ends in an
ellipsis, and its whole text is its tooltip and Diagnostics' **While tasks wait**.

While either of the two is on, the watcher also listens for the PC waking and looks again at once,
forgetting what it last read of the Codex app and of your usage, instead of waiting for its next look.

**Wait for an internet connection**, under Advanced, asks Windows - its Network List Manager, which
answers from what Windows already knows, sending nothing - whether this PC is connected to the
internet just before Codex's usage would be read for a recovery that is due. While Windows reports no
connection the recovery waits and looks again every minute, and no Codex helper is started to read
usage; *Why it is waiting* says "No internet (Windows reports)", and so does its row in the popup.
Behind some proxies Windows reports no internet where there is, which is why it is off by default.
When Windows cannot be asked or does not answer, usage is read as it always was.

### Sleep, hibernate or shut down when usage-limit recoveries finish

From v0.6.12 the watcher can put this PC to sleep, hibernate it or shut it down once every
usage-limit recovery has ended - after a task left running overnight, say. It is off by default, and
only the Dashboard turns it on: the last card under Settings > General, **When usage-limit recoveries
finish**. Choose **Then** (Sleep, Hibernate or Shut down), **When** (Every recovery succeeded, Each one
succeeded or was handed over to you, or Each one ended, however it ended), **How often** (Once, for
the next usage limit, or Every time) and **Warn me first for** (2 to 30 minutes, 5 by default), then
turn on the card's switch, as any other setting is turned on. A confirmation repeats the choices, and its
default button is Cancel; the switch stays off unless you answer **Turn on**. The card applies at once;
Save does not change it. An action Windows will not do here is left out of Then, with a line
saying why: Hibernate while it is off in Windows (this product never turns it on), Sleep while Windows
reports no sleep state a program may start, and all three while this account does not hold Windows'
shut-down privilege.

**What counts.** Only recoveries from a usage limit start it and decide it. A recovery from a
connection error, a timeout or another temporary failure never does, though while one waits or runs it
holds the power action too. The recoveries that count are the usage limits waiting when it was turned
on and every one detected after, the next limit a recovered task runs into included. **Once** is spent
on them, and turns itself off if no usage limit comes within a day; **Every time** starts again after
each such batch.

**When it acts.** At each look, in this order: a stop pressed on its notice ends the batch, and nothing
happens; a pause, Observe only or an administrator's `DisablePowerAction` holds it; every recovery of
the batch has ended, and none still waits, runs or is followed for a continuation that may still
arrive (up to a day); they ended as **When** says, or the batch ends without the action (a Once says so
in a notification); Codex has finished recording every conversation written in the last hour, no turn
is running in Codex and no input is queued there; for Shut down, nobody else is signed in to this PC;
and nobody has used this PC for 2 minutes. The card's second line says what it waits for. Then a
notification says when it will happen, with **Don't sleep** (or Don't hibernate, Don't shut down) and
**Open Dashboard**, and the card shows the same time. Any input, a pause, a gap between the watcher's
looks or anything above stopping being true ends the countdown, and a new one starts once all of it
holds again. A batch whose recoveries ended more than an hour before the watcher saw them - after a
restart, say - ends without the action. When the time is up, the watcher first records the batch as
done, then says so in a last notification and asks Windows once. Windows may refuse - a shut down asks
every program, and any of them may decline - and then a notification says so, nothing is tried again,
and the card says Windows refused.

**Turning it off.** The card's switch, which asks nothing; **Don't sleep after recoveries** (or hibernate, shut down)
in the notification-area icon's menu while it is on; the notice's button, for that batch; or, from
Codex, the tool `turn_off_power_action`. None of them can turn it on. Pausing recovery is not one of
them: it holds the power action and ends a countdown, and once you resume it acts as before. Its notices are
shown whatever the notification switches say, since they are how you stop it, though Windows' Do not
disturb may still hide them.

**What it does not check.** Only Codex in this Codex home is checked: other programs, downloads,
playback and unsaved work are not, so save your work before choosing Shut down. It sends nothing to
Codex, changes no Windows setting, starts no program and needs no administrator. Sleep and hibernate
leave Windows' wake timers as they are, and a shut down forces no program closed. What it keeps is one
file, `config\power-action.json`: ids, times and closed words, never a title or a path.

### The watcher's memory, how it stopped, and a status file

From v0.6.11 the watcher asks Windows, after every check, how much memory its own process has
committed, and keeps the most it has used; Diagnostics shows it as **Peak memory**. That is all that
happens at the defaults. **When the watcher uses too much memory**, under General > Windows, is off by
default. **Warn me** says so once, with one button that opens Diagnostics, and the watcher goes on.
**Warn me, then stop the watcher** also stops it - after the check it is in has ended, never during
one, so never while a continuation is being sent - the same way a Stop does, and Windows' own
notification says so, with one button that opens the Overview. Nothing waiting is lost, and nothing
starts the watcher again on its own: sign-in's launcher does not, and there is no other process that
would. Start it again from the Dashboard, the panel or the Start Menu when you are ready. The limit is
**Too much memory is more than**, 256 to 2048 MB - or, with Custom..., any from 128 to 16384 - 1024 by
default.

A watcher that stops on purpose - a Stop, an upgrade, the memory guard - says so as it goes. One that
is gone without having said so, in this same Windows sign-in, is shown as **stopped unexpectedly at**
the time it was last seen, in Diagnostics and in the panel in Codex; one the memory guard stopped is
shown as **stopped by the memory guard at** its time. The Overview's Right now says the same without
the time, which its Last check, just under it, gives. A watcher that ended with an
earlier sign-in, or before Windows last started, is only **not running**, as before: Windows ends it
then, which is no surprise.

**Write a status file for other tools**, under General > Windows, off by default, has the watcher write
`status.json` in its settings folder (`config\`) after every check and once more as it stops: whether
it runs, whether recovery is on, paused or observing only, the compatibility word for the Codex
engine, how many recoveries are pending at each state and when the next is looked at, and Codex's
usage as last read - the same numbers the Overview shows. It holds no conversation or record id, no
name or title and no path, is written whole or not at all, and nothing in this product reads it: it
is there for a status bar or a script of your own, which can read it without a port, a server or a
question to this product. A file that says `running` and has not changed for minutes belongs to a
watcher that is gone. Turned off, the file is removed.

### Diagnostics: the log, the state folder, and Show me what happens

From v0.6.11 the Diagnostics page has three more things, each asked only when you look, and none of
which changes anything.

**Search the log...** opens this product's own log - the one Open logs folder shows - with a search box:
the lines that hold what you type, or every line, newest last, looked at again every five seconds while
it is open. The log is written from a fixed table of messages, so it holds reason codes, conversation
ids and times and never a prompt, a reply or an error's text; `errors.log`, which keeps exception
messages as they were raised, is not read here.

**State folder**, under Health, says who Windows lets open the folder that holds the settings, the
pending tasks and the logs: **only your account can open it** - with Windows itself and the
computer's administrators, as every user folder has - or **other accounts on this PC can open it**,
with a sentence saying what that means, or **not checked** when Windows could not be asked. It reads
the folder's access list and changes nothing. Where the installer puts it, `.codex-auto-resume` in your
user folder, it is your account's alone, and the sentence says to install it there. A folder elsewhere
may not be, even one inside your user folder: where Codex's own Windows sandbox is set up, for one, its
sandbox accounts can open folders under `AppData`, and they are other accounts on this PC.

**Show me what happens** plays a recovery with made-up words, and sends nothing. A made-up task - an
example conversation whose ids are all zeros - waits on Pending for a minute, counting down, then shows
in History as recovered and goes a minute later; while the watcher runs, its icon also shows the card
an interruption gets, titled Demo, whose buttons do nothing. None of it is read from or written to the
recovery state, no action is offered on the made-up rows, and the card is never a Windows notification,
so nothing of it is left in Windows' notification center. The watcher's icon hears the request through
a Windows event of its own, which can ask for that card and nothing else.

**Install another version...**, after it, installs a release or pre-release of either edition in place
of the one you have; [Installing another version](#installing-another-version) says what it asks and
what it changes.

**Check why a failure was not taken up...**, last, asks the watcher's own rules why a failed turn was
not continued, and shows the answer with a Copy button - the most likely reason first, in plain words.
Then how each conversation of the last 72 hours has its latest turn recorded and whether it would be
taken up, or why not (another kind of conversation, before the look-back window, a newer turn, a kind
it does not recover); for one it would take up, anything else that holds it (automatic recovery or the
conversation switched off, that kind switched off in Settings, a record it already has, the watcher not
running); conversations whose turns Codex records under another id, which the watcher follows; each Codex
home with when its databases were last written; how many cloud tasks the app knows - they run on
OpenAI's servers and cannot be recovered yet; the last usage reading; how notices reach you; the Codex
version and its compatibility; and the watcher's last reasons from its log, which says once per turn why
a failed turn was not taken up. It only reads: nothing of any conversation's words, and conversations
appear as aliases valid only in that answer. Export diagnostics... includes the same check.

### Settings an administrator manages

From v0.6.11 an administrator can set seven values under `Software\Policies\CodexAutoResume` - in
`HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` for everyone who uses the PC, or in `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` for one person. This
product reads them and never writes them, and each can only hold recovery back. A PC nobody manages
has none, and then nothing is different.

| Value | Type | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DisableAutoResume` | DWORD, not 0 | Recovery is paused, and Resume is refused while the value is set. |
| `ForceObserveOnly` | DWORD, not 0 | Observe only is on: every check runs, and nothing is sent. |
| `DisableUpdateCheck` | DWORD, not 0 | The Dashboard's **Check for updates** and **Install another version...** are greyed and ask nothing. |
| `DisableStatusFile` | DWORD, not 0 | Keeps **Write a status file for other tools** off, and the watcher removes the file it wrote. |
| `MaxRecoveryAttempts` | DWORD, 1 to 20 | The most attempts per interruption: a ceiling on that setting. |
| `DisablePowerAction` | DWORD, not 0 | The power action after usage-limit recoveries is off and cannot be turned on; one turned on before stays, and does nothing (from v0.6.12). |
| `QuietHours` | String | Quiet hours that hold whatever else is set, as `22:00-07:00`, or with the days they start on: `22:00-07:00 weekdays` (or `weekends`, `every_day`). Times are on the hour or the half hour. |

Both places are read, and every restriction either one makes holds: a switch set in either is set, the
lower ceiling is the ceiling, and quiet hours set in either place hold, beside any quiet hours of your
own. A value of the wrong type, out of its range or not in its form is ignored, as if it were not there.
A value that is there and cannot be read - access is denied, say, to it or to the whole key - is never
taken for one that is not there: it holds the most it could. A switch is set, the ceiling is 1, and quiet
hours whose times cannot be read send nothing at any hour, as `ForceObserveOnly` does.
The watcher reads them at every check, the Dashboard and the panel whenever they read the settings.
While any of these values but `DisablePowerAction` is there, in either place, **Install another version...** offers no
version before v0.6.11-beta, the first that reads them: an older one would stop keeping them.

What a value decides is drawn greyed, with **Set by your administrator** under it, in the Dashboard's
Settings and in the panel in Codex. The Overview says **managed by your administrator** beside
Automatic recovery - or **paused by your administrator** - and Diagnostics names the values in force. A change to a setting a value decides is refused, except a number of attempts within the
ceiling. Your own choices stay in the settings file: nothing a value holds is written there, and they
apply again once the value is removed. A pause is the one exception: removing `DisableAutoResume` does
not resume recovery on its own - resuming is yours to do, as after an upgrade.

These values are a statement this product obeys, not a lock. It is installed for one person, in their
own folder, and someone who can change its program files can change what it does; a copy run from a
source checkout reads no values at all. `DisableUpdateCheck` turns off the Dashboard's check and its
list of versions, not a `bootstrap.ps1` you run yourself.

### Several Codex homes

From v0.6.16 (first published as v0.6.15-beta) one watcher can recover in up to three more Codex homes besides the one it finds
first (`CODEX_HOME`, or `%USERPROFILE%\.codex`). *Settings > Advanced > Codex homes* lists them: add a
folder - a Codex home with its `state_<N>.sqlite` in it - and give it a short alias. A home is refused
when it is a network (UNC) path, a link, a folder with no state database, or the same folder as one
already listed under another name. Each home is recovered through its own reader, its own Codex process
with `CODEX_HOME` set to it, its own lock and its own engine, and a record goes only to the home it is of;
Pending, History, the Codex panel and the cards show the alias beside a record of an extra home.

- **Locked by path and by folder.** Each home is locked twice - by its path and by the folder itself - so
  two installations never watch one folder, even under two spellings.
- **Only the Dashboard changes them.** Codex's `update_settings` refuses the field and no reply to Codex
  carries the paths; *Restore defaults* keeps them.
- **Removing one.** The recoveries waiting in a home you remove are cancelled; one already in Codex's
  queue there is watched until it settles, and only then is the home let go.
- **The advanced edition acts on the default home only.** Every advanced capability sees the default
  home's records alone; an extra home is recovered as the standard edition recovers.
- **Measured up to 0.162.** That the desktop app reaches a second home (measurement MH) passed on
  `codex-cli 0.158` and again on `codex-cli 0.162`. On a Codex newer than 0.162 the card says it is
  unmeasured until it is measured again.
- **A home it finds is suggested, never added.** From v0.6.18 the card says *Codex also uses <folder>.
  Watch it too?* when this PC's Codex uses a Codex home that is not watched yet. It looks in two places
  only: the `CODEX_HOME` variable of your Windows account, and the Codex app's own list of where it has
  run (`%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\chrome-native-hosts-v2.json`). A folder is offered only if it could be
  added - a local Codex home with its state database, not the default home or one already listed, under
  any spelling. **Add** adds it as *Add a Codex home...* does, with the same limit of three; with three
  added the card says so instead. **Not now** sets that folder aside for good. The switch *Suggest Codex
  homes found on this PC*, on by default, turns the looking off.

### Languages

The interface speaks English, 한국어, 日本語, 简体中文, 繁體中文, Español, Deutsch, Français,
Português (Brasil), Русский, Italiano, Türkçe, Polski, Українська, Tiếng Việt and Bahasa Indonesia.
**Interface language** defaults to *System*, which follows the first language Windows lists - in
any region, Portuguese from Portugal included, and Chinese by its script - and falls back to
English for a language this product does not ship. Arabic and Hebrew are translated too but not
offered yet: they are written right to left, and they come once every surface mirrors; a Windows
set to either speaks English here meanwhile. Each language is named in itself in the two language
lists, after *System* (or *Same as the interface*); about ten show and the rest scroll, and typing
a letter goes to the next language that begins with it. A language you choose wins over Windows
and is kept across restarts, repairs and updates. The
`CODEX_AUTO_RESUME_LANG` environment variable replaces what Windows reports, so it decides the
language only while the setting is *System*. A new language shows at once: the Dashboard reopens
itself in it, the panel redraws in it, and the popup, the menu and notifications use it from the
next time they appear.

### Text size and screen readers

From v0.6.11 the Dashboard, the notification-area popup, the notification card and the panel in Codex
draw their text at Windows' text size - Settings > Accessibility > **Text size** ("Make text bigger"),
which they read and never change. The Dashboard, the popup and the card are drawn that much larger as a
whole - the words and everything that holds them, as a larger display scale draws them - which is what
keeps any of it from being cut: each is laid out at every size as it is at every display scaling. None
is made larger than the screen it opens on holds - the Dashboard at its narrowest and its tallest dialog,
the popup whole, a card within half the screen each way - and there it is drawn at the largest size that
fits. In the panel the type grows, with everything that holds a line of it, and every other line wraps.
The Dashboard takes the size as it opens, the popup and a card each time they appear, and the panel each
time Codex opens it.

Every control a person can act on in the Dashboard has a name a screen reader says, in every language.
The popup draws itself, so Windows alone could tell a screen reader nothing of what is in it; from v0.6.11
it tells Narrator and other screen readers its counts, each task's row and its switch, the notes under
them and its two buttons - each by name, role and state, where it is, and where the keyboard is as it
moves. Pressing a switch or a button from a screen reader is exactly a click on it, on what was drawn.
Every focus ring stands at least 3:1 off what it is drawn on, in every design and theme.

### The continuation message

When the watcher resumes a task it sends Codex one short message, followed by one line it uses to
recognise the exact turn it started. **Continuation language** decides the language of that message
(by default, the interface language) and **Message style** its words:

| Style | What it says |
| --- | --- |
| Minimal | Only asks Codex to retry |
| Standard (default) | Says why the task stopped, then asks Codex to retry |
| Detailed | Also asks Codex to check the work so far and not to repeat what is already done |
| Custom | Your own words |

A **Custom** message is sent exactly as you typed it and is never translated or reworded. You can
write one message for every interruption, or one for each kind; an empty one falls back to the
message for every interruption, then to Standard. It may use `{reason}`, `{category}`,
`{attempt}`, `{max_attempts}` and `{reset_time}` and nothing else — a placeholder that would put
your prompt, the reply, a title, a path, your account or a token into the message is refused by
name — and it is at most 2000 characters. **Preview** shows the exact text that would be sent for
each kind of interruption, built by the same code the watcher sends with.

v0.6.11-beta had a fifth style, Careful, which asked what Detailed already asks; it is folded into
Detailed. If you chose it, Detailed is chosen now, and its message is what is sent.

From v0.6.11 one conversation can have a message of its own: **Message for this conversation...** on
its task's row in the Dashboard's Pending page. It is sent instead of the continuation message every
time that conversation is continued, whatever the style - for that conversation alone, and only for
an interruption that is recovered. It is a Custom message in every other way: the same placeholders,
the same 2000 characters, sent exactly as typed, and the dialog's own Preview shows what it will say.
One that fills in to nothing is not used, and that conversation gets its style's message. At most 50
conversations can have one; **Remove message**, or Restore defaults, takes it away. The settings file
keeps it beside the conversation's id, and the diagnostics bundle records only that one is set.

#### Words for this time

From v0.6.16-beta.3 one waiting task can carry words of yours for its next continuation alone: **Add
words for this time...** on its row in the Dashboard's Pending page. When that task's limit lifts and
it is continued, the words are sent once, after the continuation message it would send anyway, with one
blank line between. They start, speed up and skip nothing: the task is continued exactly when it would
be without them, and every check still applies. Once the continuation that carries them is handed to
Codex they are deleted, whatever then becomes of it - only when Codex's queue process never started are
they kept for the next try - and they are deleted too when the task ends without a send: recovered
another way, cancelled, expired or superseded. They go to that one task alone, never to another task of
the same conversation, and never twice. They are a Custom message in every other way: the same
placeholders, the same 2000 characters, sent exactly as typed, and the dialog's Preview shows the next
continuation with them. The task's *Why it is waiting* note says it has some; **Change words for this
time...** and **Remove words for this time** on the same menu change them or take them away. They are
kept in `config/once-words.json` beside the state, never in the settings, and the diagnostics bundle
records only how many there are.

Custom message text can only be written in the Dashboard. Codex can preview the message and change
its language or style, but it cannot set the text - neither the Custom messages, nor a conversation's
own, nor the words for this time: words sent automatically into your conversations must not be something
a model can be talked into changing.

Nothing about the message changes what is recovered. The style and the text choose words for a
recovery the watcher has already decided to make.

## Windows startup

Optional, per-user, and never required:

```bash
python src/auto_resume.py install --startup
```

This writes a single value under `HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run`. It needs no
administrator rights, touches nothing system-wide, and creates no service or scheduled task. It runs the
watcher with `pythonw.exe` so no console window appears, and it always pins the home directory that is
actually in effect so the autostarted watcher uses the same state and the same single-instance lock.

Running `install --startup` repeatedly does not create duplicate entries.

Consider running in the foreground for a while first, and enabling autostart only once you have seen a
real resume happen.

## Uninstall

Remove it from Windows **Settings > Apps**, run the setup program again and choose **Remove**, run
`Uninstall.cmd` from a release archive, or ask Codex to uninstall auto resume.
`Uninstall.cmd` keeps your settings and pending recoveries by default (it deletes its main and
error logs; `logs\launcher.log` and `logs\codex-start.log` stay), so reinstalling picks them up; `Uninstall.cmd -Purge` deletes those too, or you can delete the installation folder
(by default `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume\`) yourself. Asking Codex stops the watcher,
removes its Windows registrations and the plugin, and keeps your settings and pending
recoveries unless you ask it to delete them too; it leaves the installation folder, which still
holds the program files, for you to delete. `Uninstall.cmd` also removes this product's
marketplace from Codex while it still points at this installation. From v0.6.16 it, and Settings > Apps and
`winget uninstall` with it (`-Silent` for no questions), also remove the installation's entry in Add or remove
programs and the uninstaller kept for it - each only while it names this installation; an entry of that name that
names another is left as it is.

From a source checkout, the same command-line tool also deletes this tool's own state and logs
(`--keep-logs` keeps the logs; `--keep-state` keeps settings and pending recoveries):

```bash
python src/auto_resume.py uninstall
```

```bash
python src/auto_resume.py uninstall --keep-logs
```

Uninstall is deliberately conservative:

- It asks the watcher to stop first. If a watcher is still running, **or if it cannot verify
  whether one is running**, it aborts before removing anything.
- From v0.6.16 `Uninstall.cmd`, Settings > Apps and the setup program's Remove ask an open Dashboard to close
  first, as an update does, and before removing anything check that nothing of this installation still holds its
  files. If something does - a Dashboard with unsaved Settings changes, one that would not close, or a program
  still running from the installation - they stop with nothing removed and say what to close.
- It removes the sign-in autostart value, the notification identity and the Add or remove programs
  entry only while they belong to **this** installation. A value that starts a different copy of the tool is reported and
  kept, never silently removed. The Start Menu entry is kept while the notification identity
  belongs to a different installation; if no notification identity is registered at all, the
  entry at its fixed location is removed without an ownership check.
- It deletes only inside directories it can prove it owns. The source command requires this
  tool's provenance marker (`.owned-by-codex-auto-resume`) in each directory it deletes from;
  `Uninstall.cmd` requires the marker at the installation root or in `config/`, or a
  `runtime.json` that names that very directory. A directory that merely contains folders called
  `app`, `runtime`, `config` or `logs` is refused and reported, and nothing in it is deleted.
- The source command deletes only its own file names inside its own directories, so unrelated
  files there survive. `Uninstall.cmd` removes the program folders `app\` and `runtime\` whole,
  and with `-Purge` also the rest of `config\` and `logs\`.
- `Uninstall.cmd` asks the `codex` CLI to remove this plugin and its marketplace only while they
  still point at this installation; if either points somewhere else, it leaves it configured and
  says so. Removing the plugin makes Codex delete its own cached copy of it. The source command
  does not touch the Codex registration.
- None of them deletes a ChatGPT or Codex conversation, a Codex file, a user repository or a
  parent directory itself.

## Safety model

What it writes itself while running: its own `config/` and `logs/` (plus the bytecode cache
Python writes inside its own program folder). Turning start-at-sign-in on or off from the
settings changes the per-user Run value, and Windows keeps the notifications it shows in its
notification history. One thing it writes elsewhere, and only when asked: **Export
diagnostics...** on the Diagnostics page, and `diagnostics` on the command line, write one
redacted JSON bundle to a path you choose (ids replaced by aliases; paths, the Windows user name
and anything shaped like an e-mail address removed); it sends nothing and refuses to overwrite an
existing file. What it asks Codex to do, through official interfaces: queue one continuation
message for one exact thread (`codex queue`), and withdraw that same queued message if it has
to (the App Server's `thread/queue/delete`). Installing asks the `codex` CLI to register this
plugin and its local marketplace, and a marketplace already registered under this product's
name (`codex-auto-resume-windows`) is repointed at this installation. Installing also asks
Codex to refresh marketplaces. The v0.5.7 installer refreshes every Git marketplace you have
configured. Refreshing only `codex-auto-resume-windows` is new in v0.6.0. `Uninstall.cmd` asks
the `codex` CLI to unregister the plugin and its marketplace, only while they still point here. From v0.6.16
installing also writes the entry in Add or remove programs - one per-user key under
`HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall`, `CodexAutoResume`, to which the other edition's adds its
word - and keeps a copy of the installer's own uninstall in the installation (`uninstall\install.ps1`) for the
entry to name; uninstalling removes the entry, only while it names this installation.

Design rules enforced in code:

- **No network code.** Nothing in the recovery runtime imports a networking module, and a test
  fails if an import line in a tracked Python file under `src/` or `scripts/` names one of the
  common networking modules (`socket`, `ssl`, `http`, `urllib.request` and others), so the
  watcher opens no connection of its own. What does reach the network, and through what, is listed under [Privacy](#privacy).
- **Opens no Codex file for writing.** Codex databases are opened with `mode=ro` and
  `query_only`, and no Codex database, rollout or configuration file is opened for writing. For a
  database in SQLite's WAL mode, a read-only reader may still update the shared-memory index
  (`-shm`) beside it; whether Codex's databases use WAL has not been checked. Changes to Codex's
  state are requested from Codex itself, as above. The Codex processes it starts may update
  Codex's own logs and caches, as any Codex process does.
- **Fail closed.** Unknown loaded state, unknown usage, an unavailable probe, or any ambiguity results in
  waiting, never in sending.
- **Checked again at the last moment.** Immediately before sending, it re-reads the record and
  checks that it is still valid and allowed, that the same app is running with the thread
  loaded, and that usage is available (from a usage reading at most 30 seconds old). The
  reservation is one SQLite write transaction, so only one watcher can reserve a given
  interruption, and only one watcher at a time can run against the same state directory
  within a Windows session.
- **Exact thread only.** Thread ids are validated as canonical UUIDs and passed as separate argv
  elements. No Python code uses `shell=True`, `os.system`, `eval` or `exec`, and every Python
  subprocess gets an argument list.
- **Only what it can classify.** A failure it cannot classify is not retried, and neither is any
  category listed as never recovered under
  [What is recovered, and what is not](#what-is-recovered-and-what-is-not).
- **Values are data, not script.** Windows PowerShell runs the installer, the uninstaller and the
  plugin's setup script. The tool's own code also uses it, each time with a fixed script, to list
  the ChatGPT/Codex processes, raise notifications and create the Start Menu shortcut. Values such
  as a conversation title or a folder name reach those scripts as environment variables, which the
  scripts read as plain text and do not run. Releases v0.4.0 through v0.5.6 wrote those names into
  the script text, where a name containing a curly quote could run PowerShell; v0.5.7 and later
  pass them only as data.
- **No duplicate resume.** The interruption is durably reserved before any external process can
  accept a message. If the outcome of a send is uncertain, it is never resent: the watcher keeps
  checking for up to 24 hours whether the message arrived, and marks it resumed if it did.
- **Logs are built from codes, not from content.** Engine events are logged from a fixed message
  table as reason codes, timestamps and identifiers, with any other detail masked, so no prompt
  text, Codex error text or account identifier is written through it. The main log also records
  its own state directory, a path that, at the default location, contains your Windows user name,
  and the engine's version string - through v0.6.4 only for an engine this tool had not been
  verified against, from v0.6.5 for every engine, beside the Compatibility Registry's codes for it.
  Tracebacks go to a separate rotating `errors.log`, which also contains local paths. The launcher
  writes its own exception messages to `logs\launcher.log`.
- **Settings are policy only.** No setting can switch off a safety property; see
  [Settings](#settings).
- **Never used:** GUI automation, mouse or keyboard simulation, OCR, screen scraping, accessibility-API
  clicking, binary patching, DLL injection, process-memory manipulation, credential extraction. From
  v0.6.11 the popup answers a screen reader's questions about its own window (Text size and screen
  readers); it asks nothing of any other window.

## Privacy

Nothing is sent to this project: there is no telemetry, analytics, crash reporting, automatic
update check or automatic compatibility refresh, and no server of this project's to receive
them. The tool itself transmits none of your prompts, the assistant's replies, tool input or
output, file contents, account identifiers, credentials or error text anywhere. The recovery runtime (`src/`, `scripts/*.py`) imports no
networking module, and a test fails if an import line in a tracked Python file under `src/` or
`scripts/` names one of the common networking modules (`socket`, `ssl`, `http`,
`urllib.request` and others).

What this tool causes to reach the network, as far as has been checked, goes to OpenAI and
GitHub, and, while the v0.5.7 installer runs,
to wherever your other Git marketplaces are hosted:

- **OpenAI, through Codex.** Before a resume, the official Codex process this tool starts asks
  OpenAI for your current usage. The resumed turn runs in the desktop app under your own Codex
  settings and sends that conversation to OpenAI, as any turn you start does. When the plugin's
  tools or commands run inside a Codex conversation, what they return (status, pending
  recoveries with their conversation ids, and, from commands such as `status`, `doctor` and
  `logs`, local paths that at the default location contain your Windows user name) becomes part
  of that conversation, and Codex sends it to OpenAI like any tool output. In v0.5.7 the
  `get_status` and `open_settings` tools also return the installation folder's path. Removing
  it from those tools is new in v0.6.0. The commands
  still print local paths.
- **GitHub, when installing.** Installing or updating from the plugin makes the setup script
  download that version's release archive from GitHub over HTTPS (and its `.sha256` when the
  plugin has no digest recorded for that version). Nothing is uploaded, but GitHub sees the
  request, as with any download. Downloading the archive yourself is the same GitHub download;
  after that, `Install.cmd` downloads nothing itself, but it does ask Codex to refresh
  marketplaces (next item).
- **GitHub, when you ask.** *Check for updates* on the Diagnostics page asks github.com which
  release is newest, with one `HEAD` request that reads no page. From v0.6.11 it then reads
  GitHub's list of this repository's ten newest releases from api.github.com, with one `GET` that
  carries nothing about your machine, for a newer pre-release, which it only offers. *Install another
  version...* on the same page reads that list too, all of it, with up to five `GET` requests of thirty
  releases each to one more api.github.com address, when you press it and again when you confirm a
  version; then it downloads only the archive you confirmed, and its `.sha256` where no digest is pinned.
  Whether an administrator's policy is set it reads from this PC's registry, and sends nowhere. From v0.6.5, *Refresh
  compatibility data* on the same page - and a *Check for updates* that github.com answered -
  fetches the Codex compatibility data with one `GET` to one fixed address on
  raw.githubusercontent.com, with nothing about your machine in it; this installation's own
  validator keeps it only if it is valid, and it can only make the watcher more careful. None of
  it happens unless you ask for it. What other people report about a Codex version is not fetched at
  all: its counts come with the release, and your own report reaches GitHub only as a pull request
  you open with the separate reporter.
- **Marketplace hosts, while an installer runs.** v0.6.0 names only
  `codex-auto-resume-windows`; if an earlier Git registration survives the local repoint,
  Codex fetches it from wherever it points. Installers through v0.5.7 instead ask Codex to
  refresh every configured Git marketplace, whose hosts may be neither OpenAI nor GitHub.
  See [From the release archive](#from-the-release-archive).

Codex's local state is opened read-only. Recovery decisions come from Codex's structured
records (and, only where Codex recorded no error code, a short list of transport-failure
phrases in the error message), not from what was said in the conversation, but some reads do pass over conversation content: for a
usage limit it parses up to 8 MiB of the conversation's rollout file before the failure to find
the reset time, keeping only the rate-limit numbers; and to confirm its own message arrived, it
has SQLite search that conversation's user and queued messages for its own marker. That content
is handled in memory and discarded; none of it is stored, and the main log does not record it.

Its own records live in the installation folder (by default `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume\`).
Elsewhere it leaves a Start Menu shortcut, a sign-in entry, the Windows registrations its
notifications need, and this plugin and its marketplace registered in Codex; `Uninstall.cmd`
removes those that belong to this installation. Separately, Windows' notification history keeps
the notifications it showed, and each resumed conversation keeps the continuation message and
its marker as part of the conversation.

A Custom continuation message is stored only in the local settings file in the installation folder.
Like every continuation, though, what it says is sent into the resumed conversation, becomes part
of it and reaches OpenAI with it, so do not write anything there you would not put in that
conversation. The interface translations are local files installed with the product; choosing or
changing a language makes no network request. [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) has the details.

## Known limitations

- Only threads already loaded in the app can be auto-resumed. Unloaded threads wait for you to open them.
- Windows only: it works with the Windows ChatGPT/Codex desktop app, on Windows 10/11.
- The blocking usage bucket cannot always be identified with certainty, so live availability is
  re-checked immediately before sending rather than trusted from history.
- Codex app updates are survivable but not guaranteed. Database files are found by schema generation
  (`state_5` -> `state_6`) and validated by the columns actually read, and an updated engine is accepted
  when the `codex queue` interface is unchanged. A change that removes a column this tool reads, or that
  alters the queue interface, still stops it: it refuses rather than guessing.
- If the watcher process dies in the narrow window after reserving but before the send result is known,
  that interruption is deliberately left unresumed rather than risking a duplicate.
- The full end-to-end path has now been observed once in ordinary use: a real usage limit was detected,
  the thread was confirmed loaded, the interruption was reserved, one continuation was submitted through
  `codex queue`, and delivery was independently confirmed 30 seconds later. That is one run, not a
  track record. Transient-failure recovery has been exercised by tests, not yet by a real outage.
- The notification-area popup has not been exercised with a real click on its icon in Explorer.
- No translation has been reviewed by a native speaker: tests check that each one is complete, keeps its
  placeholders and is current, and wording is not checked.

## Testing

Run the automated suite:

```powershell
$env:PYTHONPATH = 'src'
python -m unittest discover -s tests
```

These tests use fakes and temporary directories. They never contact the ChatGPT app and never send a
message to any conversation, so they are safe to run anywhere and are what CI runs. CI runs every one
of them on Python 3.12, 3.13 and 3.14, each of which has to pass, and on the 3.15 pre-release as an
advisory job whose result is shown but does not block.

There is also an opt-in live check against your real environment. It verifies binary discovery,
app pairing, loaded-state classification, and usage reading. It sends no message to any
conversation; reading usage does ask OpenAI for your current usage through Codex, as the watcher
does before a resume:

```powershell
$env:CODEX_AR_LIVE = '1'; $env:PYTHONPATH = 'src'; python -m unittest tests.test_integration_live
```

## Security

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full model, the review process, and the issues that were
found and fixed. In short: the recovery runtime has no network code and reads no credentials;
it reads Codex's state read-only, opens none of Codex's files for writing, and makes its
changes to Codex's state by asking Codex through official interfaces; what reaches OpenAI is
Codex's own traffic; it fails closed; and uninstall is conservative. The only download the
shipped code makes itself is the plugin's setup script fetching the matching release from
GitHub, which it checks before installing; the v0.5.7 installer also asks Codex to refresh your
configured Git marketplaces (see [From the release archive](#from-the-release-archive)).
Release archives from v0.5.4 on also carry a GitHub build provenance attestation, and
[docs/VERIFY.md](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/blob/main/docs/VERIFY.md)
shows how to check a download yourself. Archives v0.5.0 through v0.5.7
were built by the earlier single-job release workflow, with GitHub Actions referred to by
floating tags and executables that cannot be rebuilt byte for byte; the split into build and
publish jobs, commit-pinned actions and reproducible executables are new in v0.6.0. Nothing
this project builds is Authenticode-signed; the bundled Python interpreter keeps the Python
Software Foundation's signature.

The project went through three adversarial review rounds plus mutation testing, a crash-window matrix,
and a cross-process race test. Confirmed issues were fixed and covered by regression tests.

If you find a security issue, please open an issue on this repository. Do not paste
credentials, tokens, private conversation text or private repository content into a public
issue; diagnosing a problem does not need them.

## Development and credits

Built by **songyb111-gachon** with the assistance of two AI development tools:

- **OpenAI Codex** — initial Windows/Codex architecture and protocol investigation, the exact-thread
  queue proof of concept, loaded/notLoaded verification, usage-limit and reset research, and the initial
  implementation.
- **Anthropic Claude Code** — took over that prototype, completed the watcher, CLI, Windows integration
  and persistence, expanded the tests, fixed correctness bugs, and ran the security and adversarial audits.

OpenAI Codex and Anthropic Claude Code are AI development tools, not human contributors or GitHub
accounts. See [CONTRIBUTORS.md](CONTRIBUTORS.md) for the full breakdown and
[docs/DEVELOPMENT.md](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/blob/main/docs/DEVELOPMENT.md) for the development history, including the measurements behind
the loaded/notLoaded limitation.
