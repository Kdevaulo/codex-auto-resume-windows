Codex Auto Resume runs on your machine. It has no server, no account and no telemetry, and
the watcher makes no outbound network request of its own.

This page describes the standard edition. From v0.6.11 there is an advanced edition as well
([EDITIONS.md](EDITIONS.md)): it
does everything described here and, only for a capability a person has turned on, or while a
person runs one of its measurements by hand, what [The advanced edition](#the-advanced-edition)
adds. With none turned on and no measurement run, what it adds is little more than a word in the
status saying which edition it is.

It does cause network traffic, though, and that is worth stating up front rather than in a
footnote. There are four kinds, and they are genuinely different:

- **OpenAI, through Codex.** The watcher drives the official Codex binary already signed in
  on your machine. When a recovery is due, it asks Codex for your current usage, and Codex
  asks OpenAI. From v0.6.11 it keeps the numbers of the last answer, to show you, and asks for
  nothing more for them. Codex identifies these requests as coming from this tool (client name
  `codex_auto_resume` and a version number), so OpenAI can see that you use it and when it
  checks. The resumed turn itself runs in your Codex desktop app and goes to OpenAI like any
  turn you start. And when you use the plugin's tools inside a Codex conversation, what they
  return becomes part of that conversation.
- **GitHub and, through Codex's marketplace refresh, other marketplace hosts, at install.**
  Installing or updating from the Codex plugin downloads the release from GitHub, as does
  downloading the ZIP yourself. The installer then asks Codex to refresh marketplaces: the
  installers of v0.4.0 through v0.5.7 refresh every Git marketplace you have configured,
  wherever it is hosted, while the installer from v0.6.0 refreshes only a surviving `codex-auto-resume-windows` registration, from
  wherever it points.

- **GitHub, when you ask whether there is a newer version.** From v0.6.0 the Diagnostics
  page has a *Check for updates* button, and `scripts/bootstrap.ps1 -CheckOnly` does the
  same from a command line. Pressing it makes one HTTPS request to
  `github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases/latest`. It is a `HEAD`
  request, so no page is transferred and none is read: the answer is the address the
  redirect ends at. Choosing to install then downloads that release's archive and its
  checksum, which is the same download the installer has always made.

  From v0.6.11 the same press makes one more request once github.com has answered, because
  `releases/latest` never names a pre-release: one HTTPS `GET`, without signing in, to GitHub's
  list of this repository's ten newest releases,
  `api.github.com/repos/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases?per_page=10`. No
  redirect is followed, so it goes to api.github.com and nowhere else. The list is read for the
  newest pre-release newer than both your version and the newest release; if there is one and no
  release to offer first, the window asks whether to install it, with *Not now* as the default, and
  nothing is installed unless you say yes. A yes asks both questions again, because a release may
  have been published while the question was open - then that release is what you are told about,
  and nothing is downloaded - and otherwise downloads the pre-release's archive and its checksum as
  above. A list that cannot be read, or has not arrived within the time the check has left, changes
  nothing else in the answer.

  *Install another version...*, on the same page, reads that list as well, all of it, because it
  shows every version you may pick: up to five HTTPS `GET` requests, without signing in, to
  `api.github.com/repos/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases?per_page=30&page={page}`,
  where only the page number changes, with no redirect followed. It reads them when you press the
  button and once more when you confirm a version, and at no other time; a page that cannot be read
  lists nothing and installs nothing. Confirming then downloads that one version's archive, and its
  checksum where no digest is pinned for it, as above. Whether your administrator has set a policy
  for this product it reads from this PC's registry, read only, and that answer goes nowhere.

  Nothing about you is sent. None of these requests carries an identifier this product invented — no
  installation id, no version of yours, no machine name, no account — and GitHub sees what
  it sees for any anonymous request to a public page or its API: an IP address, a time and a
  user agent. It happens when you press the button and at no other time.

- **GitHub, for the Codex compatibility data, when you ask for it.** From v0.6.5 the
  Diagnostics page has a *Refresh compatibility data* button, and `scripts/bootstrap.ps1
  -Compatibility` does the same from a command line. *Check for updates* refreshes the data too,
  once github.com has answered it, whether or not an update exists; it skips the refresh when
  github.com could not be reached, or when too little of the check's time is left. Each refresh is
  one HTTPS `GET` to one constant address, with no query string: this repository's own data file on
  its main branch,
  `raw.githubusercontent.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/main/src/codex_auto_resume/data/codex_compat.json`.
  If a redirect ends anywhere but raw.githubusercontent.com, the download is refused; as for the
  release download, that check comes after the download, so a redirect would still send the
  request to the host it pointed at before the file is refused.

  Nothing about you or this machine is in the request: no installation id, no version of yours,
  no machine name, no account - and not the Codex version you have, which is why the whole file is
  fetched and matched here. GitHub sees an IP address, a time and PowerShell's standard user agent,
  as for any anonymous download. What comes back is data and is never run: this installation's own
  validator keeps it (see [What it stores](#what-it-stores-and-where)) only if it is valid
  compatibility data, and that data can only make the watcher more careful. It happens only when
  you ask for it, with one of those buttons or those commands; the watcher never asks, and Codex
  cannot.
- **Nothing more for what other people report.** From v0.6.10 the Diagnostics page shows, beside
  the Codex version, how many of the reports other people filed for that exact version saw it
  work, saw it fail, or saw neither. Those counts are not fetched: they come with each release, in
  a file of their own (`src/codex_auto_resume/data/reported.json`) beside the compatibility data
  and never inside it, and the refresh above still fetches the compatibility data and nothing
  else. They are numbers per Codex version, naming nobody, and they are only shown - nothing that
  decides reads them. This product sends no report of its own. A report reaches GitHub only when
  its author runs the separate
  [codex-compat-reporter](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-compat-reporter), reads the
  file it wrote, and opens the pull request on GitHub themselves;
  [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#sending-a-compatibility-report) says what that pull request may
  add and how it is checked. One that passes is filed by the repository's own workflow, whose
  commit names the author's GitHub login and account number in its message, and the pull request
  and the comment it is answered with stay public on GitHub, as every pull request does.

**In the standard edition there is no automatic update check, and no automatic compatibility refresh.** (The advanced edition's *Check for updates once a week* is off until a person turns it on; its section says what it sends.) Nothing polls,
nothing checks on a schedule, and nothing checks when the window opens or when the watcher starts.
A machine that is never asked makes none of these requests, and a machine that never installs
makes none of the GitHub requests at all.

The sections below take each in turn.

## What it sends to the developer

Nothing, beyond the aggregate download count GitHub shows for every release (see
[Installing it](#installing-it)) and, if you press *Check for updates* or *Refresh
compatibility data*, up to three more anonymous requests to public GitHub addresses and, for *Install another version...*, up to five reads of the list of releases each time it is read (when you open it and again when you confirm), then the download you confirmed. There is no
telemetry, no analytics, no crash reporting, no opt-in reporting, no automatic update check and
no automatic compatibility refresh — no endpoint of any kind exists to
receive them, because no collection service is operated for this project. Local statistics
in the window are read from your own database and never leave it. A compatibility report you
choose to send with the separate reporter is a pull request you open on GitHub yourself, not
something this tool sends.

Specifically, this tool itself sends none of the following to its developer or to anyone
else; what reaches OpenAI through Codex is described next:

- your prompts, or any conversation content;
- assistant replies;
- tool input or tool output;
- file or repository contents;
- account identifiers, email addresses or subscription details;
- credentials, API keys, tokens or cookies;
- raw error bodies from the provider;
- conversation titles, project names or working directory paths;
- conversation UUIDs, recovery counts or any other statistic about what it did.

Some of it does leave your computer, and then through Codex, to OpenAI (or, for the
conversation, to whichever model provider you have configured Codex to use): the
conversation, when the desktop app runs the resumed turn; the usage check, which Codex
makes with your existing sign-in and identifies as coming from this tool; and, when you use
the plugin inside a Codex conversation, whatever its tools and commands return — which can
include conversation UUIDs, recovery counts and local paths.
[When you use it from Codex](#when-you-use-it-from-codex) says exactly what that is.

This is a property of the code rather than a policy: nothing under `src/` or `scripts/*.py`
imports a networking module, and a test fails if an import statement names one, so the
watcher opens no connection of its own. The connections it causes go through the official
Codex binary.

## Installing it

The Codex plugin is the recommended way in, and it is not self-contained: the watcher, the
settings window and the Windows runtime arrive in the release archive. So when you ask Codex
to set up auto resume, `scripts/bootstrap.ps1` downloads that archive, unless that version
is already installed and you did not pass `-Force` (then it re-runs setup instead: it
repairs the registrations and starts the watcher if it is not running) or you pass it a
file with `-ArchivePath`.

- The download contacts **github.com** and GitHub's release storage over HTTPS, following at
  most five redirects. After the download finishes, the host it finally landed on is
  checked. If it is not one of three GitHub hosts, the file is discarded and nothing from it
  runs. Because the check comes after the download, a redirect to another host would still
  send the request there, with the details below, before the file is refused.
- It downloads at most two things: this version's release archive and, only when the
  plugin carries no pinned digest for that version, the `.sha256` published beside it. From
  v0.6.11 the archive is the installed edition's - `CodexAutoResume-Advanced-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip`
  for the advanced edition - and nothing else changes.
- The URL is built from constants in the repository and the plugin's own version. There is
  no "latest", and nothing you type becomes part of it.
- It uploads nothing. No prompt, conversation, account identifier, machine identifier or
  recovery data is attached to the request. GitHub sees your IP address and PowerShell's
  standard User-Agent, which names your Windows version and locale (for example `ko-KR`),
  as it would for any download made from PowerShell.

The downloaded archive is checked before anything in it runs: against the digest pinned for
that version in the plugin's `scripts/release.json`, which comes from the main branch, where
each version's digest is committed after its release is published; or, for a version with no
pin yet, against the `.sha256` published beside it. The bootstrap says which of the two it
used. When you hand the bootstrap a file with `-ArchivePath` instead and the version has no
pinned digest, there is nothing to compare the file with; the bootstrap says so, and only
its checks of the archive's contents apply.

The installer it then runs copies the program into the installation directory, registers
that copy with Codex as a local plugin marketplace, and installs the plugin from those files,
so Codex does not fetch the plugin again. Installing repoints the `codex-auto-resume-windows`
marketplace at this installation, replacing whatever source that name had. The installer
then asks Codex to refresh marketplaces, and how far that reaches depends on the version:

- From v0.6.0, the installer runs `codex plugin marketplace upgrade codex-auto-resume-windows`
  — this product's marketplace, by name, and not the form that refreshes every Git marketplace
  you have configured. For the local marketplace just registered, that command does nothing; it
  only has an effect if an earlier registration under that name is still in place, and then Codex
  refreshes it from wherever that registration points (normally GitHub). This is new in v0.6.0.
- The installers of v0.4.0 through v0.5.7 run `codex plugin marketplace upgrade` with no name.
  Codex's own help describes that form as upgrading all the Git marketplaces you have configured,
  so installing one of those releases can contact other marketplaces' hosts as well as GitHub.

GitHub therefore sees an ordinary download request, with the IP address and User-Agent
described above, and counts it in the repository's public download total; no wording here
can make installing this tool invisible to GitHub. Downloading the ZIP yourself from the
releases page is the same kind of GitHub download, counted the same way. After that,
`Install.cmd` itself downloads nothing: it installs from the files already on disk, and its
only download-like step is the marketplace refresh described above. The Codex commands it
runs may do whatever any Codex process does at start-up, and the watcher it starts behaves
as described under [What it runs](#what-it-runs).

On that route nothing in this tool checks the archive for you — `Install.cmd` installs
whatever it was unpacked from — so check the ZIP before you extract it. In PowerShell:

```powershell
(Get-FileHash .\CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
```

Compare the result, ignoring case, with the `.sha256` file published beside the archive,
and with the digest pinned for that version in
[`scripts/release.json`](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/blob/main/scripts/release.json)
on the main branch. The pinned digest reaches you by a different channel — a commit in this
repository, not a release asset. A version is pinned once its archive has been published,
so for the newest release there may briefly be only the `.sha256` to compare with. With the
GitHub CLI you can also check which workflow built the archive, for releases from v0.5.4 on
(this asks GitHub for the archive's attestation, and fetches Sigstore's public signing
roots):

```powershell
gh attestation verify .\CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip `
    --repo songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows `
    --signer-workflow songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/.github/workflows/release.yml `
    --source-ref refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
```

An attestation says which workflow run built the archive. Archives
v0.5.0 through v0.5.7 were built by the earlier single-job release workflow, which referred to
its GitHub Actions by floating tags rather than pinned commits, and the executables in those
archives are not reproducible, so you cannot rebuild them byte for byte to compare. The
separate build and publish jobs, the commit-pinned actions and the reproducible executables are
new in v0.6.0. Nothing this project builds is Authenticode-signed — the two executables, the setup programs,
`Install.cmd`, `Uninstall.cmd` and the PowerShell scripts — while the bundled Python
interpreter (`pythonw.exe`, `python.exe` and its DLLs) keeps the Python Software Foundation's
signature, and the two Visual C++ runtime DLLs keep Microsoft's.

The watcher itself contacts no GitHub host: the code that reaches the network is the
PowerShell installer, and a test fails if any module under `src/` or `scripts/*.py` imports
a networking module. The update check and the compatibility refresh are that same installer,
run by a button rather than on a schedule, and never by the watcher. A Codex
process, including one this tool starts, may refresh Git marketplaces of its own accord;
that is Codex's behaviour, and once installing has
repointed this product's marketplace, it points at the local copy rather than at GitHub.

## What it reads

It reads Codex's own local state to notice that a task was interrupted and to decide when
resuming is safe. Codex's databases are opened read-only (SQLite `mode=ro` with
`query_only`), and rollout files are opened for reading only:

- lifecycle records — whether a turn failed, when, and where it sits in the conversation;
- the error Codex recorded for the failed turn. The category comes from the structured error
  code Codex recorded and the HTTP status it carries. The error's message text is consulted
  only when Codex recorded no code at all, and then only for a short fixed list of
  connection, timeout and stream-interruption phrases. Either way only a category name is
  kept, and the error itself is dropped at once;
- the exact conversation UUID, turn id and turn ordinal;
- the conversation's row in Codex's thread list and the first line of its rollout file (the
  session header). The header is parsed whole, up to 256 KiB, and only its id and origin
  fields are used, to confirm the conversation is a desktop-app conversation it may act on.
  The header can hold other session details as well, such as the working directory's full
  path; those are parsed and discarded;
- rate-limit and usage snapshots, for the reset timestamp;
- `threads.name`, the project name and the working directory (only its last segment is
  kept), used only as labels in a notification;
- from v0.6.11, and only while Settings let some projects resume without you and not others (the
  default lets every project resume, and then this is never read): the conversation's project id
  and working directory, read to make one SHA-256 digest of the project - the id's, or else the
  directory's - and dropped. The digest decides whether an interruption waits for you when it is
  detected; nothing is ever found by it;
- from v0.6.11, and only while the task-changed guard is on (it is off by default, and then none of
  this is read): the conversation's model and approval mode from their columns in Codex's thread
  list, where they are there, its working directory, and that directory's `.git/HEAD` - one small
  file, read as a file, never by running git, and not read at all for a network share path. The
  three are made into one SHA-256 digest and dropped; the digest is kept on the recovery to tell,
  when it falls due, whether the task changed;
- from v0.6.11, and only while the context-cost guard is on (off by default): Codex's own count of
  the tokens the conversation has used, from its thread list, where it keeps one as a number. The
  count is kept on the recovery, shown in Pending and compared with the limit you chose;
- from v0.6.11, and only while needs-you notices are on (off by default): the failed turns the
  watcher already reads for detection, now also those it never resumes, classified the same way and
  dropped but for the category; and, only while a time is chosen for a turn that has not moved, for
  each conversation's latest turn still in progress, its ids, its start time and the time its newest
  item was recorded (`thread_items.created_at_ms`) - never what any item says.

It also asks Windows content-free questions, chiefly two: which ChatGPT and Codex processes are
running (process id, parent and executable path), to find the desktop app and the Codex engine
it runs its Codex server from; and, through the
Restart Manager, which process has the conversation's lock file open, to tell whether the
conversation is open in the app. The rest are content-free too: the path and start time of a
process it found, to confirm it is still the same one; where the app runs more than one
process of the configured Codex engine, which of them has Codex's queue or state database open, asked
of the Restart Manager too, to tell which is the app's own Codex server; the per-user
registry values it registered itself; whether High Contrast is on and, from v0.6.4, whether
Windows is set to show apps light or dark - the per-user `AppsUseLightTheme` value, which it
reads and never writes - so
the Dashboard, the popup and its menu can be drawn to match; and the integrity level of the
watcher's single-instance mutex and stop event, a check that is new in v0.6.0. From v0.6.5 the
notification card and the icon's motion ask a few more, all content-free and described under
[Notifications](#notifications). From v0.6.11 an installed copy also reads, and never writes, the seven
values an administrator may set under `Software\Policies\CodexAutoResume` in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` and
`HKEY_CURRENT_USER` - five switches, a number and a span of hours (the guide's *Settings an
administrator manages*) - each time it reads its settings. Nothing else under that key is read, and a
PC nobody manages has none. From v0.6.18, to suggest a Codex home this PC's Codex uses that is not
watched yet (the guide's *Several Codex homes*), an installed copy's Dashboard reads two things each time
it shows *Settings > Advanced*, unless the switch *Suggest Codex homes found on this PC* is off: the
`CODEX_HOME` value of your account's environment (`HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Environment`), read and never
written; and the Codex app's own list of where it has run,
`%LOCALAPPDATA%\OpenAI\Codex\chrome-native-hosts-v2.json` (at most 1 MiB, opened for reading), of which
only each entry's `codexHome` folder is kept - nothing else in that file is looked at. The folders found
are checked as a home you add is checked, shown only on that card, and never sent anywhere or told to
Codex; one you set aside with **Not now** is kept in the settings file, and the diagnostics file says only
how many. Also from v0.6.11, and only while the setting that needs it is on (each
is off by default): how long the PC has been awake (`QueryUnbiasedInterruptTime`), which beside the
clock says how long it slept, and a notice from Windows when it wakes
(`RegisterSuspendResumeNotification`), for **Ask me after a sleep longer than** and **Keep this PC
awake**; whether the PC runs on mains power (`GetSystemPowerStatus`), for **On mains power only**; and
whether Windows reports this PC connected to the internet (the Network List Manager's
`GetConnectivity`), for **Wait for an internet connection** - a question Windows answers from what it
already knows, with nothing sent to find out. **Keep this PC awake** is a request, not a question:
`SetThreadExecutionState`, which the watcher makes and takes back and which changes no setting.
From v0.6.12 the power action after usage-limit recoveries, which is off by default, asks
Windows three more things. The first is whether this account holds the shut-down privilege
(`GetTokenInformation` on its own token, `TokenPrivileges`) and which sleep states the PC offers
(`GetPwrCapabilities`), which say whether Sleep, Hibernate and Shut down can be offered: the
Dashboard asks it each time it shows the power action's card in Settings and when the power action
is turned on, and the watcher while it is on. The other two the watcher asks only while it is turned
on: how long ago the last keyboard or mouse input came (`GetLastInputInfo` - a time, never what was
typed or where, with no hook); and, for Shut down, how many other sessions are signed in
(`WTSEnumerateSessionsW` - a count, never a user name). For the same check it counts, in Codex's own
database, the latest turns still in progress and the items queued in this Codex home, and compares
the size of each conversation file written in the last hour - and of each of the recoveries' own -
with how far Codex has recorded it: one look at the file's size and time, and the file is never
opened. Only counts and a yes or no are kept, for that look.
And from v0.6.11 at every setting, about the watcher itself: how much memory its own process has
committed and the most it has (`K32GetProcessMemoryInfo`, of that process only); the number Windows
gives the sign-in it runs in (`GetTokenInformation` on its own token, `TokenStatistics`, of which only
that number is kept - a counter that names no one, new at every sign-in); and how long ago Windows
started (`GetTickCount64`). The Dashboard, the panel and `get_status` ask the last two of their own
process, to compare - that is how a watcher that stopped unexpectedly is told from one that ended with
an earlier sign-in. Also from v0.6.11, the Dashboard as it opens, the popup and the notification
card each time they appear, and the panel each time Codex opens it read Windows' text size - the per-user
`TextScaleFactor` value under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Accessibility`, which they read and
never write - to draw text at it. At the same moments they ask which face Windows' interface font is and
which of the product's own letters, in the language it speaks, that face and Segoe UI have a glyph for
(`GetGlyphIndicesW`), so a language that font lacks letters of is set in Segoe UI. The Dashboard's Diagnostics also looks, when it opens, at which edition Codex's own
copy of this plugin is: the names of the folders in Codex's plugin cache under
`codex-auto-resume-windows`, and whether one folder is in the newest - no file is opened. From v0.6.11
it also asks, then, who Windows lets open this product's `config\` folder: the folder's access list
(`GetNamedSecurityInfoW`, the list alone) and this account's own security identifier from its own
token (`GetTokenInformation`, `TokenUser`), to compare the two. Only one word is kept of the answer -
your account only, other accounts too, or not checked - and nothing is written.

From v0.6.5, for the Codex Compatibility Registry, the watcher also reads the shape of Codex's
databases - which tables they have and which columns those tables have, by name only, through the
same read-only connection, never a row - and whether Codex's `sessions` and `thread-writer-locks`
folders exist.

No decision rests on the text of your messages, except whether one of them carries this
tool's own marker (below). It never selects the `title`, `preview` or
`first_user_message` columns, which on the current Codex schema contain the raw first
message, and the conversation-name label comes from `threads.name` only. Identity always
comes from the UUID, never from a label.

Four reads pass over your conversation itself, and it is better to say so plainly:

- **For a usage limit only**, to find when the limit resets, it reads up to 8 MiB of the
  conversation's rollout file ending at the failure, into memory. That part of the file is
  your conversation. It keeps only the rate-limit numbers and whether the failure was a
  usage limit, and discards the rest when the scan ends.
- **To prove its own message arrived**, it has SQLite search that conversation's user
  messages and queued messages for its own marker. SQLite reads those rows to answer; only
  rows containing the marker — the tool's own continuation message — come back.
- **To read what its own message led to**, it asks SQLite how many items of each kind the one
  turn that message started holds, whether any user message in that turn is not its own, and
  whether a later turn has finished. Those rows are your conversation — the assistant's replies
  in that turn, and anyone else's messages in it — but only counts and yes/no answers come back,
  never text. What is kept is that turn's status and whether anything was produced in it.
- **Only when you press Rescan and reconcile** (from v0.6.16), and only for a waiting recovery whose
  conversation Codex's history has not caught up with, it reads that conversation's current rollout
  file, up to 32 MiB, a line at a time, for the failed turn's own end and, after it, a message of
  yours that carries no marker of this tool's. Each line is parsed and dropped; only the answer -
  whether such a message is there - is kept.

No conversation content from any of them is stored, logged or sent. What is kept is the reset
time (which is also logged) and the limit's bucket name, and the id of the tool's own queued
message.

It does not itself open a Codex database, rollout or configuration file for writing. SQLite's
read-only access does take shared locks and, for a WAL-mode database, opens the
shared-memory index (the `-shm` file) for writing to update it. It does not take the app's
thread writer lock, and does not itself read credential storage: the Codex processes it
starts use Codex's own stored sign-in, and this tool never sees it.

When Codex's state has to change, it asks Codex to make the change through Codex's own
interfaces:

- `codex queue` adds its one continuation message to one exact conversation;
- the App Server's `thread/queue/delete` withdraws that same message, when it has to;
- at install and uninstall, `codex plugin marketplace add` registers the installation
  directory as the `codex-auto-resume-windows` marketplace and `remove` removes it by name,
  and `codex plugin add` and `remove` act on this plugin. In v0.4.0 through v0.5.7,
  `codex plugin marketplace upgrade` acts on every Git marketplace you have configured;
  acting on that marketplace alone, by name, is new in v0.6.0 (see [Installing it](#installing-it)). Installing repoints the
  `codex-auto-resume-windows` marketplace at this installation, replacing whatever source
  that name had; uninstalling removes it only while it still points at this installation.

Codex makes those changes itself. The Codex processes it starts may also update Codex's own
logs and caches as a side effect, as any Codex process does. In the advanced edition, a
capability that is on asks for more, described under
[The advanced edition](#the-advanced-edition).

## What it runs

Every process it starts for recovery runs on your machine, against the Codex installation
already there:

- the official `codex` binary — `codex queue` to continue the conversation, and
  `codex app-server --stdio` to read your usage and to remove a queued item it put there
  itself. The only requests it sends the App Server are `initialize`,
  `account/rateLimits/read` and `thread/queue/delete`, plus the `initialized` notification
  that completes the handshake; it refuses every request the server sends back;
- short `codex --version` and `codex queue --help` probes, to confirm it is driving the
  interface it expects;
- Windows PowerShell, by its full path under `System32` and with fixed scripts, to list the
  running ChatGPT and Codex processes and to raise a notification. The Restart Manager is
  called directly, not through PowerShell. Setting up the Start Menu shortcut runs a fixed
  PowerShell script too.

Values such as a notification's label or a shortcut's path reach those scripts as
environment variables rather than as script text, so PowerShell does not parse them as code.
From v0.4.0 through v0.5.6 the names a notification shows were written into the script, and
a conversation, project or folder name containing a curly quote could run as a command
(before v0.4.0, notifications held only fixed text, a time and a short id). In v0.5.0
through v0.5.6 the Start Menu shortcut's paths were written into its script the same way;
those come from where the tool is installed rather than from a conversation. v0.5.7 fixed
both. No Python code here uses `shell=True`, `os.system`, `eval` or `exec`, and every
Python subprocess gets an argument list. Installing, uninstalling and the plugin's setup are PowerShell
scripts as well (`install\install.ps1`, `scripts\bootstrap.ps1`), and the installer runs
the `codex plugin` commands listed above. The update check and, from v0.6.5, the compatibility
refresh are `scripts\bootstrap.ps1` too, started from the window by Windows PowerShell's full
path; the refresh then runs this installation's own bundled Python once, to validate what it
downloaded.

The resumed turn is not run by any of those processes. `codex queue` places the message in
Codex's queue and exits; your Codex desktop app picks it up and runs the turn, signed in as you
and under your own settings, exactly as if you had typed the message yourself, and sends it to
OpenAI as it does every turn. From v0.6.3 that message is written in the continuation language
you chose - by default the interface language - from translations that ship with the product,
or, if you chose the Custom style, it is your own Custom message exactly as you typed it. Like
every continuation, it becomes part of the resumed conversation that Codex sends to OpenAI, so
write nothing in it you would not type into that conversation yourself.
The one thing this tool asks the Codex processes it starts to
fetch from OpenAI is your usage (`account/rateLimits/read`). Codex identifies these requests as
coming from this tool (client name `codex_auto_resume` and a version number), so OpenAI can see
that you use it and when it checks. Every App Server session it opens, including one that only
withdraws its own queued message, introduces itself to Codex that way. In v0.5.7 and earlier
releases the version it gives is a fixed `0.1`; giving the product's real version is new in
v0.6.0. It asks for usage only when a recovery is due and the conversation is open in the app,
and reuses the answer for 30 seconds. What a Codex process does on its own account when it
starts — keeping its sign-in current, for instance — is Codex's behaviour, not something this
tool requests, and it has not been measured.

Every `codex` process the recovery runtime starts runs with `OTEL_SDK_DISABLED=true` set in
its environment. The `codex app-server` and `codex queue` processes also get flags that turn
analytics off (`analytics.enabled=false`), set the OpenTelemetry exporters
(`otel.exporter`, `otel.trace_exporter`, `otel.metrics_exporter`) to none, turn prompt
logging off (`otel.log_user_prompt=false`) and pin the ChatGPT base URL to the official one.
Those settings apply only to the processes this tool starts. They do not change the desktop
app: the resumed turn runs in the app under your own Codex settings.

## When you use it from Codex

The plugin gives Codex tools — `get_status`, `list_pending`, `get_recovery_timeline`,
`get_recovery_statistics`, `open_settings`, and the controls (`retry_now`, `cancel_recovery`,
`reset_recovery_budget`, `pause_auto_recovery` and `resume_auto_recovery`,
`disable_conversation_recovery` and `enable_conversation_recovery`, `clear_recovery_history`,
`start_watcher`, `update_settings`, `restore_default_settings`, from v0.6.11 `postpone_recovery` and `release_hold`, and from v0.6.12 `turn_off_power_action`), and, from v0.6.3, `preview_recovery_message` — in the advanced edition also
`list_advanced_capabilities`, `disarm_advanced_capability` and `disarm_all_advanced` — and a skill that runs the
tool's commands (for example `status`, `pending`, `doctor` and `logs`). When they run inside a
Codex conversation, what they return becomes part of that conversation. The
one-line summary always does, and the structured data may as well; Codex sends the
conversation to OpenAI like any tool output. That is:

- from `get_status`: the version and, from v0.6.11, the edition installed (a code: standard,
  advanced, or advanced_not_loaded), whether recovery is on, whether the watcher is running and
  whether sign-in autostart is registered, counts by state, and your settings — which
  say only whether you set a Codex executable path, never the path itself, and, from v0.6.3, the text of any Custom
  message you have written (Codex can read it there, not change it). From v0.6.5 it also
  carries the Codex compatibility summary that the Dashboard's Diagnostics page shows, as codes
  only: the overall result and the one the watcher acts on, whether the
  compatibility report could be used, where the compatibility data came from and its sequence
  number, the refreshed data's standing, when the check ran, and each capability's state and
  reason — no Codex version string, no path and no free text, and not what other people report
  about that version, which is for you to read on the Dashboard. It no longer returns the installation
  directory's path, which normally includes your Windows user name; v0.5.0 through v0.5.7
  did, and a conversation held with one of them still carries it. In the advanced edition it also
  carries which edition this is and how many of its capabilities are on, as codes. From v0.6.12,
  while the power action has its file, it also carries that action's state: what is turned on (the
  action, when, once or every time, the warning's length and since when), what it waits for, when a
  countdown ends and how the last batch ended - closed words and times, no id;
- from `turn_off_power_action`, from v0.6.12: whether the power action was on - one sentence;
- from `list_pending`: the pending recoveries, with their conversation ids, interruption ids,
  states, categories, times and attempt counts, and the finished ones too when it is asked for
  them; `open_settings` returns those together with the status and settings above;
- from `get_recovery_timeline`: one recovery's whole chain as event codes, reasons, actor, turn
  references, counters and times, with the interruption ids of that chain and not the
  conversation's — codes and times only, no prompt, reply or error text;
- from `get_recovery_statistics`: over the last few days or all of it, how many interruptions
  were detected and how many continuations were sent, how they ended, the medians and a count by
  kind — numbers only;
- from `preview_recovery_message`: the exact text a continuation would have for one kind of
  interruption, under your settings or under a language and style given for the preview —
  this product's message or, when the Custom style is selected, your Custom message. It saves
  nothing and sends nothing;
- in the advanced edition, from `list_advanced_capabilities`: each capability's id, whether it
  is on, watched or off, since when, from which surface and why, whether it is kept on and whether
  with Send again, the code of what a capability kept on would otherwise have turned itself off for,
  the values of the choices set for it, and the ids of the standards it departs from
  ([STANDARDS.md](STANDARDS.md)) — ids, codes and yes-or-no values, with no version string, path or free text; from the two tools
  that turn capabilities off, the capability's id and that it is off, or how many were turned off;
- from the commands: the same, plus each pending recovery's reset time, limit bucket and
  last reason code, the desktop app's process ids, and local paths such as the Codex executable, the Codex home,
  the state file and the log file — which normally include your Windows user name — and,
  from `logs`, recent log lines.

None of it is prompt text, assistant output or tool content. The window opened from the Start
Menu reads the same information on your machine and sends it nowhere. No tool can refresh or
import the Codex compatibility data: that is done only from the window or a command line, as
described at the top.

## What it stores, and where

Its own records live in its installation directory, `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-auto-resume\` by
default (or wherever `CODEX_AUTO_RESUME_PLUGIN_HOME`, or failing that
`CODEX_AUTO_RESUME_HOME`, points):

- `config/state.sqlite` — pending recoveries: conversation UUID, the interruption's id, the
  failed turn's id and ordinal, timestamps, failure category, for a usage limit the limit's
  bucket name and reset time and whether that reading was uncertain, attempt counts, state,
  flags and the last reason code, and the two ids it needs to prove delivery (its marker and
  the queued item's id); also the on/off switch for recovery, with when it was switched on
  and the poll interval, and the switch for each conversation. From v0.6.11 it also has room
  for a time a recovery is postponed to, a word for why one waits for you, a word for how much
  a conversation asks first, an observe-only switch, and needs-you notices - each the failure's,
  or the turn's that stopped moving, and the conversation's ids, its kind and times - and, only
  while a guard is on, a
  digest of what the task was working with and its conversation's token count; all of it empty
  until you use it.
  Beside those it holds a bounded
  journal of what happened to each recovery - codes, ids, actor, turn references, counters and
  times, at most 5,000 entries and 90 days, with no prompt, reply or error text - and one row
  for the watcher itself: its process id, session id, start and last-tick times, and which code
  version wrote them - and, from v0.6.11, the last usage reading it made and when: for each window
  only its bucket (`codex`, `premium`, `legacy` or `other`) and slot, how much is used, its length
  and when it resets; no account, plan or credit; and, while it keeps the PC awake, since when; and
  from v0.6.11 the most memory its process has committed, whether it last stopped on purpose (and
  when), the number Windows gives the sign-in it ran in and when Windows started. None of it is
  content;
- `config/status.json` — from v0.6.11, only while **Write a status file for other tools** is on (off
  by default): whether the watcher runs, whether recovery is on, the compatibility word, how many
  recoveries are pending at each state and when the next is looked at, and the last usage reading's
  numbers. No id, name, title or path. Nothing in this product reads it, and it goes when the setting
  is turned off;
- `config/state.vN-backup-<timestamp>.sqlite` — a copy of the state file, taken before the first
  watcher of a new version upgrades the schema and before `downgrade-state` rewrites it. It holds
  what `state.sqlite` held, and it is kept to explain a bad upgrade rather than as a way back.
  Deleting `state.sqlite` does not remove it: `Uninstall.cmd` with `-Purge` takes it with the
  rest of `config/`, and without `-Purge` it stays, as the state file does; the command line's
  `uninstall` deletes `state.sqlite` unless you pass `--keep-state`, and leaves this copy either way;
- `config/settings.json` — your settings, including the interface and continuation languages
  and, from v0.6.3, any Custom message you write in the Dashboard: the message for every
  interruption and any per-kind ones, each at most 2,000 characters, stored exactly as typed. From
  v0.6.11 it may also hold two lists of projects you set, on a task's row, to resume or to wait for
  you: at most 50 each, and each project only as the 64-digit digest described above - never its
  name or its path; and a message you wrote for one conversation, from its task's row in the
  Dashboard, beside that conversation's id: at most 50 of them, each a Custom message in every way;
- `config/strings-cache.json` — written by the Dashboard window so it can show its first screen
  without waiting for the Python side: the interface text in the language it resolved, the stored
  Interface language and the language Windows prefers, and the key that says whether the copy is
  still good - the window's version, the installation's full path (which normally includes your
  Windows user name), SHA-256 digests of the interface catalogs, the language modules and
  `settings.json` (a digest of it, not its contents), the values of `CODEX_AUTO_RESUME_LANG`,
  `LC_ALL`, `LC_MESSAGES` and `LANG`, and your Windows display languages. Nothing in it is about
  your conversations, and it holds no Custom message text. The window uses it only while that key
  still matches and writes a new one otherwise; deleting it only makes the next opening a little
  slower. `Uninstall.cmd` with `-Purge` removes it with the rest of `config/`;
- `config/compat-cache.json`, from v0.6.5 — the Codex compatibility data you last asked for, kept
  only if it passed validation. Its one writer is this installation's validator (`controlcli
  compat-import`): a refresh downloads to a temporary file, hands it to the validator and deletes
  it, and `auto_resume.py compat --import FILE` hands it a file you supply. It holds the data file
  as published - the Codex versions it covers, capability states and reason codes, dates and a
  sequence number - with when it was stored and whether it came from a refresh or a file. Nothing
  in it is about you, this machine or your conversations. It is checked again every time it is
  read, and one that fails is ignored, never deleted;
- `config/compatibility.json`, from v0.6.5 — the watcher's latest compatibility report, and the
  watcher is its only writer: the product version, the version string `codex --version` printed,
  a SHA-256 digest of the Codex executable's resolved path (the digest, not the path, which normally
  includes your Windows user name), that executable's size and modification time, how many
  candidates were found, what each local check found, which compatibility data was in force, and
  each capability's state and reason code. It is regenerated as the watcher runs; deleting it only
  makes the window, the panel and the command line show unknown until it is written again. Both
  compatibility files go with the rest of `config/` under `Uninstall.cmd -Purge`, and the command
  line's `uninstall` deletes both unless you pass `--keep-state`;
- `config/failure-seen.json`, from v0.6.8 — one time: when a person last saw a failed recovery,
  by opening the notification-area popup or bringing the Dashboard to the front. The watcher writes
  its start there when there is none (and checks at every tick), and the popup and the window move it
  forward. It says nothing
  about which recovery failed or about you, and only decides whether the icon and the taskbar button
  are red. Deleting it only means a failure is not shown red until the watcher starts again. It goes
  with the rest of `config/` under `Uninstall.cmd -Purge`, and the command line's `uninstall` deletes
  it unless you pass `--keep-state`;
- `config/power-action.json`, from v0.6.12, only once the power action after usage-limit
  recoveries has been turned on in the Dashboard: what was chosen, in closed words; when it was turned
  on; the ids of the recoveries it waits for (this product's own interruption ids, never a
  conversation's); a random number naming the current batch, which the countdown notice's button
  carries; what it last showed; and how the last batch ended, with the time. No title, path or
  text. Deleting it turns the power action off. It goes with the rest of `config/` under
  `Uninstall.cmd -Purge`, and the command line's `uninstall` deletes it unless you pass
  `--keep-state`;
- `config/split-chains.json`, from v0.6.16-beta.3, only once Codex has recorded a conversation's turns
  under another id (issue #30) — for each such conversation, the ids its turns have been recorded under,
  per Codex home by a digest of that home's path (never the path itself), at most 2000 conversations of
  64 ids each per home. Ids only: no title, path, text or time. The watcher writes it, the Dashboard's
  check reads it; deleting it only means such a conversation's earlier ids are found again from Codex's
  file names. It goes with the rest of `config/` under `Uninstall.cmd -Purge`, and the command line's
  `uninstall` deletes it unless you pass `--keep-state`;
- `config/once-words.json`, from v0.6.16-beta.3, only while a waiting task has words for this time
  you added in the Dashboard: for each such task, this product's own interruption id (never a
  conversation's), the words exactly as you wrote them, and when you wrote them. The words are sent
  once, after that task's next continuation, into that conversation, as a Custom message is. Each
  task's entry is deleted as the continuation carrying the words is handed to Codex, when you remove
  the words, and - at the watcher's next look - when the task ends without a send; the file itself is
  deleted when it holds nothing. The settings file never holds them, and the diagnostics bundle records
  only how many there are. It goes with the rest of `config/` under `Uninstall.cmd -Purge`, and the
  command line's `uninstall` deletes it unless you pass `--keep-state`;
- `config/reopen-after-update-<process id>.txt`, from v0.6.16, only for the moment an update (the setup program,
  or `-Silent`) asks an open Dashboard to close: the page the Dashboard was on, its place and size on screen,
  its theme and design and which control had the focus - no conversation, path or text. The installer reads it
  once to open the new version where it was, and deletes it;
- `config/edition-left.txt`, from v0.6.16, only when an uninstall keeps your state (as `Uninstall.cmd` does
  unless you pass `-Purge`, and `uninstall --keep-state` does): one word, the edition that uninstall took
  away. The installer reads it when it installs the advanced edition over state left behind, to tell the same
  edition coming back from a change of edition, and the next install deletes it. No path, id or text. It goes
  with the rest of `config/` under `Uninstall.cmd -Purge`, and the command line's `uninstall` deletes it unless
  you pass `--keep-state`;
- `logs/` — `auto-resume.log`, what the watcher did, by reason code and conversation UUID;
  `errors.log`, the Python traceback when something goes wrong; `launcher.log`, a line
  per launch (and why, if one failed); and, from v0.6.9, `codex-start.log`, a line each time Codex
  starts the plugin's MCP server, holding that process's id, what Windows wrapped it in and which
  of a fixed set of decisions was taken - no path, no file name, nothing from a conversation.

Engine events are written from a fixed message table. The main log also records the state
directory's path, which normally includes your Windows user name, and the version string
`codex --version` printed - until v0.6.4 only for a Codex version this tool was not verified
against, from v0.6.5 for every version, beside what the compatibility data says about it, as
codes. Prompt text, assistant output, tool output and Codex's error text are not deliberately
written to any log. When something fails, `errors.log` receives the full Python traceback, and
`launcher.log` and `errors.log` receive the exception's message; this tool does not control
what text an exception carries.

From v0.6.11 the Dashboard's Diagnostics can search `auto-resume.log` and its rotated copies:
the bridge reads them on this PC when you open **Search the log...** and hands the window the lines
that match, and nothing else reads or sends them. `errors.log` is not read there. **Show me what
happens**, beside it, plays a recovery with made-up words: nothing about it is read from or written
to the recovery state, and its one card, drawn by the watcher's icon when a named Windows event of
its own asks for it, is never a Windows notification, so none of it stays in the notification center.

Beside those it keeps the program itself (`app\` and `runtime\`), the window, the
icon notifications use, the sign-in launcher, and `runtime.json`, which records where the
plugin is installed.

One more file appears while an installation replaces one that is already there:
`.codex-auto-resume-install-journal.json`, at the installation root. A first install writes
none, because it has nothing to move aside. The installer writes it before it moves anything,
and it holds the time it was written, the installation directory, and one entry per program
folder being replaced - `app\` or `runtime\`, the path it lives at, and the `*.old-*` name it
was moved aside as. Nothing in it is about your conversations: it is a handful of directory
names, times and a format number. Those paths sit inside the installation directory, which
normally includes your Windows user name. It is deleted as soon as both folders are in place,
so a run that finished leaves none behind. Finding one means an installation did not finish -
it lost power part way, or it failed and put the old copy back - and the next run reads it to
restore anything still moved aside instead of sweeping it up. Uninstalling removes it with
the rest.

One more file exists only if you ask for it, and only where you put it. **Export
diagnostics...** in the window, or `auto_resume.py diagnostics` on the command line (`--out`
names the file; without it, a new one in the current directory), writes one JSON file: your
settings (a Custom message included), one entry per recovery with its state,
reason and the checks it is waiting on, up to 2,000 journal entries, and the last 300 lines
of each log. Conversation and interruption ids are replaced by aliases that mean nothing
outside that one file; paths, your Windows user name and e-mail-shaped text are removed.
`errors.log` can carry exception text this tool did not write, which is redacted the same way
rather than filtered - so read the file before you send it to anyone. Nothing is sent by this
tool, and a file that already exists is never overwritten.

Two traces of your conversations live outside that directory, and neither is written by
this tool directly.
Windows keeps the notifications it showed in its notification history for a while, or until
you clear them - from v0.6.5 including the silent copy raised for each notification card.
And each resumed conversation contains the continuation message (your Custom message, when that
is what was sent), with its
`[codex-auto-resume:…]` marker, in Codex's own history, like any message - or, in the advanced
edition with the marker-free continuation on, without the marker, under a client id Codex keeps
on the message.

Outside that directory it also registers ordinary per-user Windows plumbing, none of it
needing administrator rights and none of it containing anything about your conversations: a
Start Menu shortcut carrying the tool's notification identity, which Windows requires before
it will draw a toast at all; the registry entry that gives that identity its name and icon;
the sign-in autostart value (unless you skip it); and the handler for the notification
button's `codex-auto-resume:` link; and, from v0.6.16, the entry in Add or remove programs (one per-user key under
Windows' Uninstall key that names the version, the folder and the command that removes it, with a copy of the
installer's own uninstall, `uninstall\install.ps1`, kept in the installation for it to name). Through the `codex plugin` commands it registers this
plugin and its local marketplace in your Codex configuration, and Codex keeps its own copy
of the plugin. Uninstalling removes those Windows entries, the Add or remove programs entry among them, each only while it
belongs to this installation, and asks Codex to remove the plugin and the marketplace only while they still point at this
installation; Codex then removes its own copy.

While the uninstall that Settings > Apps starts runs (v0.6.16), a copy of the Dashboard program is in a new folder
of its own in your temporary folder, `CodexAutoResume-Uninstall-<random>`, so that the installation can be deleted
while the window shows it. It holds the program and nothing of yours, and the folder is removed once the copy has
ended.

Uninstalling keeps the state directory by default so a reinstall does not lose pending
recoveries; `Uninstall.cmd -Purge` removes it. You can delete it yourself at any time.

## Notifications

Windows notifications are raised locally through the operating system's own notification
API. They show up to two labels — drawn from the conversation's name as Codex stores it, the
project name and the folder name — each on one line and at most 72 characters, plus the
conversation UUID. A usage-limit notice also shows the local reset time. They carry no error
text or account data, and this tool does not route them through any service. If Codex
derived the name from your first message, the label reflects it, as Codex's own list does.

From v0.6.3 a transient interruption's notification also names the kind of interruption, and
both interruption notifications carry an **Open Dashboard** button. It opens the Dashboard's
Pending page through the same `codex-auto-resume:` handler as the cancel button, and does
nothing else.

The popup that opens from the notification-area icon, new in v0.6.3, shows up to three
waiting tasks: each one's conversation name, from the same read-only source the Dashboard and
the notifications use (`threads.name`) and on one line of at most 120 characters, with the
kind of interruption and when it is next checked. The watcher draws it on your machine and it
sends nothing anywhere. It adds nothing to the logs but a line naming a popup action that
failed, with its refusal code or exception class.

From v0.6.5 a notification can appear as the product's own card beside the notification area
instead of as a Windows toast. It is on by default and switched off under Settings > General >
Windows. What the card shows is what the toast shows - the same lines, drawn from the same
sources, and the same buttons - plus the product's name, a status light and, for a detected
interruption, the kind of interruption as a word from the product's own translations. The watcher
draws it on your machine, as it draws the popup; nothing new leaves the machine for it, and no
service is involved, as none is for the toast. Once the card has been on screen, the same toast is
raised silently - no banner, no sound - so Windows' notification history holds what it held before;
if a card cannot be drawn, the toast is raised instead. A card's button does what the toast's
does, in the watcher itself rather than through the `codex-auto-resume:` handler: cancel one
recovery, open one page of the Dashboard or, from v0.6.12, stop the power action for one batch. Each press leaves one line in the log: the
conversation's UUID when it cancelled one, or a refusal code or an exception class when nothing
happened, as the toast's buttons do.

From v0.6.11, only if you turn it on, a notification also tells you when a conversation needs you:
a failure it never resumes, or a turn that has recorded nothing new for the time you chose. It shows
what the other notifications show - the labels and the conversation UUID - with the kind as a word
from the product's own translations and one next step from them, never error text; its one button
opens the Dashboard's Settings page. With **Play a sound for these** on it is always Windows' own
toast, whose own audio element names Windows' reminder sound; otherwise it makes no sound. It is
kept as a row of ids, its kind and times, so that it is told once.

To decide whether a card may be drawn at all, the watcher asks Windows content-free questions each
time: whether Windows is accepting notifications right now (not locked, not a full-screen app or a
presentation, not quiet time), whether Do not disturb or Focus is on, whether notifications for
this product are switched on in Windows' Settings, whether a screen reader is running, whether the
session is remote, and whether the desktop taking input is still yours. For how the card and the
notification-area icon move, it asks whether battery saver is on and how long Windows keeps a
notification on screen, and it notices when the session is locked or disconnected - which the
settings window's taskbar button asks Windows outright for this session, so that it stops behind the
lock screen as the icon does - and whether the icon is in the overflow area, which it reads from the
settings Windows itself keeps for the notification-area icons (`NotifyIconSettings`). To find its own
icon there it looks through every program's entry: it reads each entry's icon number and whether it
has a GUID, and the program path only of an entry that could be its own, and keeps none of it. The icon
also reads whether the overflow flyout's own window is shown - a window's class and whether it is shown,
nothing of what is in it, and nothing kept - because the icon moves while the flyout is open and stands
still only while it is closed. It reads these and changes none of them; any answer it cannot get means Windows' own toast.

## Languages

From v0.6.3 the interface - the Dashboard, the popup and menu, notifications and the panel in
Codex - and the continuation message are available in nine languages, and from v0.6.11 in
sixteen. The translations ship
inside the release, one JSON file per language, and are read from disk: no language data is
fetched and no translation service is used. The default, *System*, follows the first
language Windows lists on this machine; a language you choose is stored in
`config/settings.json` with your other settings.

## The advanced edition

From v0.6.11 there is a second edition, and this section is what it adds to everything above. Its
capabilities are each off until a person turns one on, in the Dashboard's **Advanced features** page.
With none on, and no measurement asked for, it runs nothing more and asks Codex for nothing more; it
reads more only when its capabilities are listed or one is being turned on - and, while a capability
that takes up failures is on or watched, from Codex's history the failures the standard edition
leaves alone: their kind, Codex's error code and status number, and whether an error message exists,
never the message; for the one that retries failures it cannot classify, also how many items of each
kind the failed turn left - and Codex's tools learn which edition it is and that none is on. It adds no network code: its package imports no networking
module, which a test checks as it checks the standard edition's code
(`tests/test_privacy_claims.py`), and what its capabilities ask of anything, they ask of the Codex
already on this machine - but for the compatibility report, which asks gh, the GitHub CLI you
installed, to reach GitHub, and only when you start it (*What it sends to GitHub*, below).

- **What it reads.** Three values an administrator may set under
  `Software\Policies\CodexAutoResume`, in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE` and `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` -
  `ForbidAdvanced`, `ForceShadow` and `AllowedCapabilities` - read and never written: when the
  capabilities are listed, over that bridge or by `list_advanced_capabilities`, when one is being
  turned on, and at each look while one is on or watched. While the goal continuation is on or
  watched, from Codex's goals database, opened read-only: which goal a conversation has, its status
  and when it changed. The goal's words are never selected. From v0.6.16-beta (first published as v0.6.15-beta), while the capabilities
  that use them are on: from Codex's turn history, the kinds and counts of the items a turn left, whether
  it recorded a final reply, a plan's step statuses (never a step's words), and from the state database
  which subagents a conversation spawned and how each one's latest turn ended, as a category word.
- **What it runs.** While start with Codex is on, when Codex starts the plugin's MCP server and
  Codex's job would end what the server starts: one constant PowerShell script, by its full path,
  that asks WMI (`Win32_Process.Create`) to start this installation's own launcher, windowless, and
  writes the new process's id to a temporary file it reads back and deletes. Where the job would not
  end it, the server starts the launcher itself, as *Start watcher* does. While the marker-free or the
  goal continuation is on: `codex app-server --stdio` sessions of their own, started as the standard
  edition starts its own - the same client name, the same analytics and telemetry settings, the same
  pinned ChatGPT address - that call, after `initialize`, only the methods that capability declares (the advanced package's `codex/protocol.py`): `thread/queue/add` (the continuation's
  words, under a client id derived from the interruption), `thread/goal/set` (a goal's status), and, for the capabilities that run, compact or
  re-model a conversation here, `thread/resume`, `turn/start`, `turn/interrupt`, `thread/compact/start`, `model/list`,
  `thread/settings/update` and `thread/unsubscribe`, and, for usage and a reset credit, `account/rateLimits/read` and
  the account's request that spends one reset credit; nothing else.
- **What reaches OpenAI.** Nothing new from a capability, except the turn run while Codex is closed
  (the next bullet) and that Codex is asked about your usage on a schedule while one of these is on: the early
  usage-reset check every five minutes while a conversation waits for a reset, the usage meter every 5 to 60 minutes
  (15 by default), and a waiting reset-credit rule or reset message about every 15 minutes
  (`account/rateLimits/read`, as the standard edition asks when a recovery is due); a reset credit the credit capability
  spends is one of your own, used on your account: the resumed
  turn still runs in your Codex desktop app. A marker-free continuation arrives without the `[codex-auto-resume:…]` marker,
  and Codex keeps the client id on the message. A goal set active is left for Codex to carry on when
  the app next opens the conversation, under your own Codex settings. A measurement is the
  exception, below.
- **What else it starts or reads near a notice or a limit.** While *Open Codex on a notice* is on, pressing *Open Codex* starts
  `explorer.exe` with the conversation's `codex:` link, and the program reads - never writes - whether Windows has
  something registered for such links. While *Stop near a limit* is on, a window that reaches its stop percentage
  has each running turn stopped through the Codex app's own channel, the `\\.\pipe\codex-ipc` pipe, once for that window.
- **A conversation run while Codex is closed.** With the advanced edition's feature that runs a
  conversation here while Codex is closed, and the features that build on it, a turn runs on Codex's own
  app server on this PC, started by this program and signed in as you, under the conversation's own
  saved settings. Like every turn it reaches OpenAI through Codex. The program reads only the kinds of
  items the turn left and Codex's error codes, never what anyone wrote.
- **What it stores.** `config/advanced/advanced.sqlite`, made only when something is first turned
  on or changed: each capability's state, since when, from which surface and why, the statement
  revision and the Codex version it was turned on for, and the warnings confirmed; each unit a
  capability spent, with the ids of the conversation and interruption it spent it on; the edition's
  own records and what a capability asked of a standard one, as ids, states and times; the global
  ceiling a person set; a journal and per-day counts of closed codes, bounded as the standard
  journal is, and what a watched capability would have done at most 150 lines each (180 until
  v0.6.16-beta.4); and, for the
  capabilities that use them, the choices you made, the rules you wrote (an
  error code, status numbers, a kind), which capability took up which interruption, and samples of
  failures it could not classify: Codex's error code, the status number, the form of the error, item
  counts, a time rounded to the minute and a duration - never a word of the error or the
  conversation, and kept 90 days at most. A message you wrote for a reset (from v0.6.14) or queue (from
  v0.6.16-beta) is kept there until it is sent - a series until its last occurrence - cancelled or ended,
  and then deleted; the edition's own continuations, in its fixed words, until they are sent; and which
  conversations you keep going, with their counts. No reply, error text, title, path or secret. `Uninstall.cmd -Purge` removes it
  with the rest of `config\`. A diagnostics export you ask for adds, for each capability watched or
  with answers in the last 30 days, the capability's own id, the minute it has been watched since,
  the minute its answers are counted from and whether older ones were cut; and the word of each
  answer it would have given, where it was asked, how many times and the first and last minute. No
  conversation's or interruption's id.
- **What it sends to GitHub.** Besides the weekly update check below, only the compatibility report, only while it is on, and only after you
  type `send` in the Dashboard for exactly the file and the writes it showed you: through gh, signed in
  as you, it forks the project, adds the report on a branch and opens a public pull request, so the
  report, your GitHub login and the fork are public. The report is the one codex-compat-reporter
  writes: counts, states and times for one version of Codex, the product's version and edition and the
  Windows build, with no conversation text, id or path. Before that, and only while it is on, checking
  what sending would write asks GitHub questions through gh and writes nothing; while it is only
  watched, the report is written, shown and saved where you choose, and GitHub is asked nothing. gh
  reads your GitHub sign-in itself, from Windows' credential storage or its own file, and makes every
  request as your account with its own User-Agent; the product never sees the sign-in, starts gh by
  its full path from a folder on PATH with no shell, gives the file to it on its standard input, and
  writes no temporary file. A paused recovery stops any checking or sending; the report and its
  status are kept only in the Dashboard's memory, and its journal holds only closed codes.
- **Check for updates once a week.** While that capability is on, at most once a week, while no recovery waits, is
  sent or is watched, and never while recovery is paused or `DisableUpdateCheck` is set, the watcher runs the installed
  `scripts/bootstrap.ps1 -CheckOnly` - the requests a *Check for updates* you press makes, to github.com, to the list of
  releases on api.github.com and, once github.com has answered, for the Codex compatibility data on
  raw.githubusercontent.com - so GitHub sees this PC's address and the time, once a week. It downloads nothing; the
  time of the last check, and a version it found, are kept in `config/advanced/advanced.sqlite`.
- **What Codex is told.** What its three MCP tools return, listed under
  [When you use it from Codex](#when-you-use-it-from-codex).
- **Measurements.** The harness that measures whether a capability's route can work on this Codex
  (`measure`) is in the edition's archive and runs only when a person asks for it over the
  Dashboard's bridge, whether or not any capability is on, and on a conversation they name where it
  needs one. Each run opens one app server session limited to the methods that measurement
  declares, and some of them send the conversation words this product wrote, which then reach
  OpenAI through Codex, under your account, as any turn does: M6 starts a model turn there itself,
  asking Codex to run `whoami`; M2b and M7 queue *Reply with the single word: ok.* and `/compact`,
  which the app runs as a turn once it takes them; M2 and M2b set the conversation's goal active,
  which Codex may then carry on. MA reads the account's state from Codex, and keeps only that it
  could. MP1 reads the list of the Codex home's MCP servers, which Codex starts to answer it as the
  app does when it starts, and keeps only how many there were and whether this product's panel is
  among them as Codex shows it. A record is written only where a source checkout's `docs/evidence/live/` is, and holds
  booleans, counts, closed words and ids as aliases, never a path or a conversation's text. An
  installed copy has no such folder, and there the record is refused only after the calls were
  made, so run a measurement only on a throwaway conversation.

## Third parties

**GitHub**, for the release download when you install or update from the plugin, or when
you download the ZIP yourself; for the marketplace refresh described under
[Installing it](#installing-it) when a marketplace it refreshes points at GitHub; for *Check
for updates*, which from v0.6.11 also reads this repository's list of releases from
api.github.com; for *Install another version...*, which reads that whole list there and downloads
the version you confirm; from v0.6.5, for the Codex compatibility data from raw.githubusercontent.com
when you ask for it; and, in the advanced edition, for the compatibility report you send, through gh
under your own GitHub account (*What it sends to GitHub*, above). It is subject to GitHub's own privacy
practices, as any download would be.

**OpenAI**, only through the official Codex app and CLI already signed in on your machine:
the usage check, which Codex identifies as coming from this tool; the resumed turn; and
whatever the plugin's tools and commands return inside a Codex conversation. This tool has
no connection to OpenAI of its own; that traffic is Codex's, under your own account. If you
have configured Codex to use a different model provider, the conversation goes there
instead, as all your Codex conversations do.

**Other marketplace hosts**, through Codex's marketplace refresh at install: a surviving
registration named `codex-auto-resume-windows` is refreshed from wherever it points, and the
installers of v0.4.0 through v0.5.7 refresh every Git marketplace you have configured, from
wherever each one points. Refreshing only this product's marketplace, by name, is new in
v0.6.0.

Beyond these, and a host that a GitHub redirect might send the download request to (see
[Installing it](#installing-it)), this tool sends nothing to any other party; Windows may
make certificate checks of its own during the download. What runs is
the Python standard library, the interpreter that ships in the release archive, two small
Windows programs built from this repository — the settings window and the MCP launcher —
Windows PowerShell, the .NET C# compiler Windows PowerShell uses to build the shortcut
helper when it creates the Start Menu shortcut, `cmd.exe` (with `chcp.com`, which sets the
console to UTF-8) for `Install.cmd` and `Uninstall.cmd`, and the Codex installation already
on your machine.
