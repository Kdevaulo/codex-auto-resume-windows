# Verifying a release

How to check that the setup program or the archive you are about to install is the one this
project published, what the Codex plugin checks for you, how to rebuild a release yourself, and
what none of that covers.

From v0.6.11 a release publishes two editions, and every check below applies to each of the four
files it installs from, with that file's own name and its own `.sha256`:

| Edition | Archive | Setup program |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Standard | `CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip` | `CodexAutoResume-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe` |
| Advanced | `CodexAutoResume-Advanced-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip` | `CodexAutoResume-Advanced-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe` |

The commands below use the standard names; for the advanced edition, put its names in their place.
One attestation names all four, so `gh attestation verify` finds it for whichever file you give it,
and it is worth running on the setup program and on the archive alike. Each edition's archive has a
pin of its own in `scripts/release.json` (step 3 below). Releases up to v0.6.10 have the standard
archive alone.

## Why it is worth doing

What you extract from the release archive - or what the setup program unpacks for you - runs as
you. It installs a watcher that, unless
you opt out, starts at every sign-in and can queue messages to your Codex conversations,
and it registers a plugin that Codex runs.

`Install.cmd` does not check the archive it came in. By the time it runs, the archive has
already been unpacked, and the installer cannot tell a genuine download from a modified
one. The check has to happen before you extract, and on the manual route you are the one
who makes it.

The programs and scripts this project builds are not code-signed (the bundled Python
interpreter keeps the signatures it was published with: the Python Software Foundation's,
and Microsoft's on the two Visual C++ runtime DLLs; see [Code signing](#code-signing)), so
the Windows dialog that would normally name a publisher has no publisher to name for them.
The digest is the check.

## Before you run a downloaded setup program

`CodexAutoResume-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe` is the release archive in one file: it carries
`CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip` byte for byte, unpacks it into a new folder of its own in
your temporary folder, runs that archive's `Install.cmd` there and removes the folder. So checking
the setup program is checking what it carries. From the
[releases page](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases), download
it and the `.sha256` file published beside it. Do not run it yet. In PowerShell, in the folder you
saved them to:

1. **Compare it with the `.sha256` published beside it.**

   ```powershell
   $hash = (Get-FileHash .\CodexAutoResume-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
   $hash -eq ((Get-Content .\CodexAutoResume-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe.sha256 -Raw) -split '\s+')[0]
   ```

2. **If you have the GitHub CLI, check the build provenance**, as step 4 of the archive's list
   below does: the one attestation of a release names every file it publishes, the setup programs
   too - both editions' archives and both editions' setup programs.

   ```powershell
   gh attestation verify .\CodexAutoResume-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe `
       --repo songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows `
       --signer-workflow songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/.github/workflows/release.yml `
       --source-ref refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
   ```

   For the advanced edition's setup program, the same command with
   `.\CodexAutoResume-Advanced-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe`.

Then double-click it. It is not code-signed, so SmartScreen may show *Windows protected your PC*:
choose **More info**, then **Run anyway** (see [Code signing](#code-signing)).

`scripts/release.json` pins archives, not setup programs, so step 3 of the archive's list has no
counterpart here. What ties a setup program to that pin is the archive it carries: in a checkout of
the tag, with the published archive, setup program and its `.sha256` in `build/dist`,
`python build/make_setup.py --check` reads the archive out of the setup program and compares it
with the one beside it byte for byte, and builds the setup program again around that archive and
compares the two (see [Rebuilding a release yourself](#rebuilding-a-release-yourself)); the
archive's own digest is then the one step 3 compares. For the advanced edition's pair, add
`--edition advanced`.

The setup program checks the archive it carries against the SHA-256 compiled in beside it, and
stops when they differ. That catches a damaged download or disk, not a replaced file: whoever could
change the archive inside could change the digest beside it. The checks above are what tell you it
is the file this project published. A release published before the setup programs existed has
none; its archive is checked as below.

## Before you extract a downloaded archive

From the [releases page](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases),
download `CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip` and the `.sha256` file published beside it.
Do not extract anything yet. In PowerShell, in the folder you saved them to:

1. **Hash the archive.**

   ```powershell
   (Get-FileHash .\CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
   ```

   `Get-FileHash` prints the digest in upper case; the published values are lower case.
   Compare them ignoring case. PowerShell's `-eq` already does, so each comparison below
   prints `True` or `False`.

2. **Compare it with the `.sha256` published beside the archive.**

   ```powershell
   $hash = (Get-FileHash .\CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash
   $hash -eq ((Get-Content .\CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip.sha256 -Raw) -split '\s+')[0]
   ```

   The release page also shows a SHA-256 digest beside each asset, computed by GitHub from
   the file it stores. It should be the same value.

3. **Compare it with the digest pinned for that version on `main`.** Open
   [`scripts/release.json` on the main branch](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/blob/main/scripts/release.json)
   and find the version, without its leading `v`, in the `sha256` table - for the advanced
   edition's archive, in the `sha256` table inside `advanced`, which begins at v0.6.11. A version
   is pinned in both tables in the same commit. Then:

   ```powershell
   $hash -eq '<the value listed for X.Y.Z>'
   ```

   Read it from `main`. The archive contains `release.json` itself, so it cannot contain
   its own digest. The pin is committed after the release is published, so the copy at
   the tag, committed before that, does not have that version's digest either (at most a
   `null` placeholder, which the bootstrap treats as absent). v0.5.0 and v0.5.1 have no
   entry at all; see the note after these steps.

4. **If you have the [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/), check the build provenance.**

   ```powershell
   gh attestation verify .\CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip `
       --repo songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows `
       --signer-workflow songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/.github/workflows/release.yml `
       --source-ref refs/tags/vX.Y.Z
   ```

   This succeeds only if an attestation exists for exactly this file's digest, signed for
   a run of `.github/workflows/release.yml` in this repository for the tag `vX.Y.Z`.
   Without `--signer-workflow` and `--source-ref`, the command accepts an attestation from
   any workflow run in the repository, on any branch or tag. Every archive from v0.5.4
   onwards has an attestation.

   The attestation also names a commit. For an archive published by a tag push, that is the
   commit that was built. The earlier single-job workflow, which built every archive from
   v0.5.0 through v0.5.7, could also publish from a manual run: among its versions that attest
   (v0.5.4 on), a run started on the tag, while that version had no assets yet, could publish
   and attest a build of any ref whose `plugin.json` declared that tag's version. The
   attestation records which event started the run. The workflow from v0.6.0 publishes only
   from a tag push; that change is new in v0.6.0.

   **If you do not have the GitHub CLI**, the same attestation can be checked with
   `sigstore-python`, which is what was used here. Install it into a throwaway virtual
   environment, fetch the bundle for the digest you measured, and verify:

   ```powershell
   py -3 -m venv .\sigstore-venv
   .\sigstore-venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install sigstore
   $digest = (Get-FileHash .\CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip -Algorithm SHA256).Hash.ToLower()
   $url = "https://api.github.com/repos/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/attestations/sha256:$digest"
   (Invoke-WebRequest $url -UseBasicParsing).Content |
       ConvertFrom-Json | ForEach-Object { $_.attestations[0].bundle } |
       ConvertTo-Json -Depth 40 | Set-Content bundle.sigstore.json -Encoding utf8
   .\sigstore-venv\Scripts\python.exe -m sigstore verify identity `
       --bundle bundle.sigstore.json `
       --cert-identity "https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/.github/workflows/release.yml@refs/tags/vX.Y.Z" `
       --cert-oidc-issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" `
       .\CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip
   ```

   This is the same question `gh attestation verify` asks, by a different road: the
   signature under the short-lived Fulcio certificate, that certificate's chain to the
   Sigstore root, the certificate-transparency timestamp embedded in it, and the entry in
   the Rekor transparency log. For v0.6.0 all four passed, and
   [`docs/evidence/attestation-verified-2026-09-13.json`](evidence/attestation-verified-2026-09-13.json)
   records the run - the identity the certificate carried, the nine tamper controls used to
   show the checks are not no-ops, and the three things it still does not tell you: the
   Sigstore root is trusted on first use, the bundle carries no separate timestamp
   authority, and provenance says a workflow produced these bytes, not that the workflow
   builds what it claims to.

Extract the archive and run `Install.cmd` only when every check you made agrees. If any of
them disagrees, do not extract it: delete the file and open an issue with the version and
the values you got.

A pre-release - a tag with a suffix, such as `vX.Y.Z-alpha` - is never in the pin table either, and
that is deliberate: the table's keys are releases, and `releases/latest` does not answer with a
pre-release. From v0.6.11 the Dashboard's update check can offer a newer one, and installs it only
when you say yes, checked against the `.sha256` published beside it - step 1 of the list above, done
for you. For a pre-release, steps 1, 2 and 4 are the whole check,
with `--source-ref refs/tags/vX.Y.Z-alpha` in step 4, and step 3 does not apply.

*Install another version...* on the Dashboard's Diagnostics page checks a picked version the same
way: against the digest pinned for that edition and version in the installed copy's
`scripts/release.json` where there is one - it holds the pins of the releases published before the
version you have - and otherwise against the `.sha256` published beside it, saying which; a version
published with neither is greyed and never fetched. Its archive then goes through every contents
check below, and nothing from it runs, and nothing of your state is converted, until all of them
passed. It does not check the attestation either.

v0.5.0 and v0.5.1 predate the `sha256` pin table and have no entry. For them only the `.sha256`
and the release-page digest apply (they have no attestation either). Any other version
that is on the releases page but missing from the table was published recently, and its
pin commit has not landed yet. You
can wait for it, or rely on the `.sha256` and the attestation, knowing what each one does
and does not prove:

| Check | What it tells you | What it does not |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `.sha256` beside the archive | The download is intact: you have the file GitHub is serving. | Who put it there. It comes from the same place as the archive, so a replaced archive can come with a matching replaced `.sha256`. |
| Digest on the release page | The same, computed by GitHub rather than by the workflow. | The same. |
| Digest pinned in `release.json` on `main` | The file is the one the maintainer recorded after publication, through a separate channel: a commit in the repository's history rather than a release file. Changing it takes another commit on `main`, which shows in the history unless someone with write access rewrites that history with a force-push; whether the branch is protected against that has not been verified. | That the file was built from the tagged source. The maintainer took the digest from the published file. |
| `gh attestation verify`, with the options in step 4 | The file was built by a run of the release workflow in this repository for that tag. For an archive published by a tag push, it was built from the commit the attestation names; the earlier single-job workflow could also publish from a manual run on the tag that built another ref whose `plugin.json` declared that version, and the attestation records which event started the run. | That the commit contains what you would want it to. |
| Rebuilding it yourself | For a release whose tag contains `build/normalize_pe.py`: the bytes come from the tagged source. | It applies to no release from v0.5.0 through v0.5.7, because none of their tags contains that file. See [the limitation](#what-a-rebuild-can-and-cannot-show-today) below. |

## What the plugin route checks for you

When you install from Codex, the plugin's `scripts/bootstrap.ps1` makes these checks
itself, before anything from the archive runs:

- From v0.6.11 it fetches the installed edition's archive, by that edition's own name, and checks
  it against that edition's own pin. An update stays in the edition that is installed. It refuses
  an archive of the other edition: one that holds anything of the advanced package when the
  standard edition was asked for, and one without the package when the advanced edition was.
  Moving to the other edition is a reinstall you ask for, and it is said before anything is
  fetched.
- It downloads from one URL shape, built from constants in `scripts/release.json` and the
  version in the plugin's own manifest. There is no "latest", and nothing you type becomes
  part of the URL.
- It uses HTTPS with TLS 1.2 at minimum, and refuses the download unless the final host,
  after redirects, is `github.com`, `objects.githubusercontent.com` or
  `release-assets.githubusercontent.com`.
- It compares the archive's SHA-256 with the digest pinned in the plugin's copy of
  `scripts/release.json`. A plugin added from the GitHub marketplace carries the pins that
  were on `main` when Codex last fetched it. If it was added before the pin commit landed,
  it falls back to the `.sha256` and says so. Installing, by either route, normally
  re-registers the plugin from the installed copy, whose `release.json` comes from the archive and so
  cannot hold its own version's digest. A later `-Force` or `-ArchivePath` run through
  that copy falls back to the `.sha256`, or compares against nothing, and says so.
- It checks that the archive holds the files every release must contain (the interpreter,
  the MCP server, its launcher and `.mcp.json`, the settings window, the plugin manifest,
  the setup script and the installer), that the payload root holds the settings window and
  its icon and nothing else — the installer copies that root into the installation home —
  that the manifest inside names this product at this version, and that no entry escapes
  the folder it is extracted into.
- Any failure stops, and the script then deletes its working copy of the download.

It does not check the attestation. When the installed version already matches, it
downloads nothing and re-runs setup instead, unless you pass `-Force`.

If you downloaded the archive yourself and also have the plugin, you can hand the file to
the same script with `-ArchivePath`. It is then checked against the pinned digest when
that version has one; in the plugin copy an install registered, the installed version has
none (see above). When it has none there is no published checksum to fetch for a local
file, so the script prints that the SHA-256 was not checked against anything, and only
the contents checks apply. When the installed version already matches, the script does
not use the file at all and re-runs setup instead, unless you also pass `-Force`.
[`docs/PLUGIN.md`](PLUGIN.md) describes the script in full.

## Upgrading from v0.6.2 to v0.6.3

The v0.6.3 archive is checked like any other, before it is extracted: the steps above, with
v0.6.3's own file and values. v0.6.2's pin on `main` vouches for v0.6.2's file and nothing
else. v0.6.3 is published and its own pin is committed, so step 3 has a digest to compare
with, and so are v0.6.4, v0.6.5, v0.6.6, v0.6.7, v0.6.8, v0.6.9, v0.6.10, v0.6.11, v0.6.12, v0.6.13, v0.6.14 and their pins. A release that has just been published has no
pin for a little while - until the pin is committed, step 3 has nothing to compare its archive
with, which is the case [a new release has no pin for a while](#what-is-not-verified)
describes.

From v0.6.2 there are two routes, and both end in the same installer with `--keep-state`:
extracting the archive and running `Install.cmd`, or the Dashboard's update button, whose
verification step v0.6.2 repaired. An installation still on v0.6.0 or v0.6.1 carries the
update script that could not verify what it downloaded, so move it by installing the
archive the ordinary way.

v0.6.3 changes one default on purpose. The message sent to continue a task used to be one
fixed English sentence per kind of interruption; after the upgrade it is the Standard message
in the continuation language, which on an English system reads almost the same.

### What to look at once it is installed

Verifying says the file is the one this project published; it does not say the new parts
behave. v0.6.3 changes what the product says and shows rather than what recovery decides,
and these are worth a few minutes by hand. [`LIVE_ACCEPTANCE.md`](LIVE_ACCEPTANCE.md) says
how to make each check during an acceptance and where to write it down.

- **Interface language** (Settings → General): a choice other than System is used by the
  window, the popup, notifications and the panel, and is still chosen after the watcher
  restarts and after you sign in again.
- **Message style** and **Preview** (Settings → Continuation message): Preview changes with
  a choice before it is saved, and saves nothing.
- **Custom**: a message using `{reason}` is accepted and previewed exactly as typed; a
  placeholder outside the five allowed ones is refused by name and changes nothing; an empty
  message for one kind of interruption falls back to the message for every interruption,
  then to Standard.
- **Pending**: a task's **Auto-resume** switch changes that task only, and a click on a task
  that changed first is refused and changes nothing; **Cancel all** cancels every pending
  recovery and turns no conversation off.
- **The header** names what the watcher is doing, and **Reduce motion** (Settings →
  Appearance) stops its animation and the popup's.
- **The notification-area icon**: one click opens a small window and a second closes it;
  clicking elsewhere or pressing Esc closes it; its switch refuses a task that changed
  first; its **Open Dashboard** opens the window; restarting Windows Explorer brings the icon
  back.
- **Notifications**: an interruption's notification offers **Open Dashboard**, which opens
  the Pending page and cancels nothing.
- **The panel in Codex**: its Preview matches the Dashboard's, and a Custom message is shown
  there but cannot be changed.

Do these in a conversation you can throw away. The notification check needs a real
interruption: induce a transient one as `LIVE_ACCEPTANCE.md` describes, and never fake a
usage limit. Nothing here should be arranged by editing Codex's databases or this product's
state, and every click should be yours rather than a script's.

## Rebuilding a release yourself

A rebuild compares a published archive with what its tagged source produces. It can match only
for a release whose tag contains `build/normalize_pe.py`, and no release from v0.5.0 through
v0.5.7 does. Reproducible builds - `build/normalize_pe.py`, the CRLF checkout and the release
workflow's second build - are new in v0.6.0. Every archive published so far, v0.5.0 through
v0.5.7, was built by the earlier single-job release workflow, which referred to its actions by
floating tags rather than pinned commits, and its executables carry a build time and a random
GUID that no rebuild reproduces. For those releases, the digest checks above apply, and the
attestation check applies from v0.5.4 on (there is no pinned digest for v0.5.0 or v0.5.1).

For a release whose tag has `build/normalize_pe.py`, you need:

- Windows 10 or 11 with .NET Framework 4.8, whose C# compiler the build uses. Windows 11
  and Windows 10 version 1903 or later include it; an older Windows 10 build, such as
  LTSC 2019, comes with 4.7.2, so for a digest comparison install 4.8 first.
- Git.
- Python on `PATH`. The build runs on Python 3.12 or newer, but for a digest comparison
  use Python 3.13, the line the release workflow uses. The archive is written by the
  `zipfile` and `zlib` modules of the Python that runs `build/make_release.py`, and on
  Windows, Python 3.14 and later use a different zlib implementation (zlib-ng), so a
  newer Python can write a different archive from identical files.
  `python -c "import zlib; print(zlib.ZLIB_RUNTIME_VERSION)"` prints the zlib yours uses;
  the builds compared so far all used zlib 1.3.1. The workflow does not pin the 3.13 patch
  release, and its run log names the one it installed.

No administrator rights are needed. The build downloads the embeddable Python it bundles
from python.org and refuses it unless its SHA-256 matches the one written in
`build/make_release.py`.

Start from a fresh clone. The archive packs source files, so their line endings are part
of its bytes, and an existing working tree may have been checked out under different
settings (see [below](#how-the-build-is-made-reproducible)).

```powershell
git clone --branch vX.Y.Z --depth 1 https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows.git
cd codex-auto-resume-windows
git rev-parse HEAD
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build/make_gui.ps1
python build/make_release.py
Get-Content .\build\dist\CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip.sha256
```

`git rev-parse HEAD` prints the commit you built; it should be the commit the attestation
names. The last line should match the published `.sha256` and the digest pinned on
`main`. If it does, the published archive is exactly what that source produces.

For the advanced edition of a release from v0.6.11 on, build its window and its archive too, then
compare as above:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File build/make_gui.ps1 -Edition advanced
python build/make_release.py --edition advanced
Get-Content .\build\dist\CodexAutoResume-Advanced-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip.sha256
python build/edition_audit.py
```

The last command is the proof the release workflow runs before anything is published: from the
two archives and the two setup programs in `build\dist`, that the standard ones hold nothing of the
advanced edition, that the standard archive built again with `advanced/` deleted is the same file,
and that every standard entry is in the advanced archive unchanged. It rebuilds the standard
edition to do so, so it needs what a release build needs.

For a release that publishes setup programs, `build/make_release.py` also writes
`CodexAutoResume-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe` beside the archive, compiled around it, with its own `.sha256`;
that should match the published one too. To check a published setup program against a published
archive instead, put both, with the setup program's `.sha256`, in `build\dist` and run
`python build/make_setup.py --check`: it reads the archive out of the setup program and compares it
with the one beside it byte for byte, compares the setup program with its `.sha256`, and builds the
setup program again around that archive and compares the two. The release workflow runs the same
check before anything is published.

`build/make_gui.ps1` prints the compiler it used (a `compiler` line with its version) and the
SHA-256 of each executable it built. The release run's log in the repository's Actions tab has
the same lines while GitHub retains the run's logs, which is for the repository's retention
period (90 days unless the repository sets otherwise), and GitHub shows them only to signed-in
users. In that log, the step that builds the executables a second time prints each one's digest
again. Comparing those tells you whether a difference is in the two compiled programs or
somewhere else. These lines and the second build are new in v0.6.0; the runs that built v0.5.0
through v0.5.7 print each executable's size, with no `compiler` line and no executable digest.

### How the build is made reproducible

These are new in v0.6.0.

- The in-box C# compiler has no `/deterministic` switch. Two builds of the same source
  differ, as measured, in exactly two fields: the PE header's timestamp and the module's random version
  GUID (MVID). `build/normalize_pe.py` sets the timestamp to a constant and replaces the
  GUID with one derived from the module's own content. It refuses a file that fails its
  structural checks, for example one with a debug directory or a PE checksum. It also
  refuses an executable holding a class the compiler named with a random GUID, which a long
  string `switch` produces, so such a build fails rather than producing bytes a rebuild
  cannot match.
- `build/make_release.py` writes the archive with a fixed file order, fixed entry
  timestamps and a fixed compression level, and puts no path from the build machine in
  it. The compressed bytes still come from the zlib of the Python that runs it.
- `.gitattributes` checks every text file out with CRLF whatever the machine's Git
  settings, so the source files packed into the archive have the same line endings on
  every fresh checkout. The repository itself stores LF.
- The release workflow builds the executables twice and refuses to continue if the two
  builds differ.

### What a rebuild can and cannot show today

Two builds from two fresh clones of one commit, on one machine with the same compiler and
Python, produced a byte-identical archive, executables included. From v0.6.0 there is a
second result, and a stronger one: the archive GitHub's runner published and a rebuild of
that tag from a fresh clone, on a different Windows machine, have the same SHA-256 - the
whole ZIP, not only the files inside it.

The run log names the runner's compiler, and it was the same in-box build as the
rebuilding machine's - `4.8.9221.0 built by: NET481REL1LAST_25H2` on both. So this is a
**same-toolchain, cross-machine** match: the machine and the Windows build were different
(Windows Server 2025 against Windows 11), the compiler build was not. The two executables
matched the digests the run printed for them, and then the whole archive matched.

That leaves one thing deliberately unclaimed. The result depends on the build of the
in-box compiler, which can differ from one Windows installation to another, and two
*different* compiler builds have never been compared. So this says these two builds
agreed, not that every Windows machine will.
[`docs/evidence/reproducible-build-2026-09-13.json`](evidence/reproducible-build-2026-09-13.json)
records both toolchains and all three digests.

So a match is strong evidence. A mismatch is a reason to look closer, not proof of
tampering:

- **The tag predates reproducible builds.** That is the case for every release from
  v0.5.0 through v0.5.7. If the tag's source has no `build/normalize_pe.py`, its executables were
  stamped with a build time and a random GUID, and no rebuild of them will match.
- **A different compiler build.** Compare the `compiler` line your build printed with the
  one in the release run's log, while that log is retained.
- **A different Python or zlib build.** If every file inside the two archives is
  identical (the comparison below prints nothing) but the archive digests differ, the
  difference is in how the archive was written, which points to the compressor. Check
  that you built with Python 3.13 and which zlib it reports.
- **Which files differ.** This compares the files inside two archives without extracting
  either. Run it in the clone, with `$published` set to where you saved the download. It
  prints nothing when every file is identical, and otherwise lists each differing file
  with the side it came from: a file whose content differs appears once for each archive,
  and a file missing from one archive appears once.

  ```powershell
  function Get-ZipDigests([string]$Zip) {
      Add-Type -AssemblyName System.IO.Compression.FileSystem
      $archive = [IO.Compression.ZipFile]::OpenRead((Resolve-Path $Zip))
      try {
          foreach ($entry in $archive.Entries) {
              $stream = $entry.Open()
              try { $digest = (Get-FileHash -InputStream $stream -Algorithm SHA256).Hash }
              finally { $stream.Dispose() }
              [pscustomobject]@{ Name = $entry.FullName; SHA256 = $digest }
          }
      } finally { $archive.Dispose() }
  }
  $published = "$HOME\Downloads\CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip"   # where you saved it
  Compare-Object (Get-ZipDigests $published) `
                 (Get-ZipDigests .\build\dist\CodexAutoResume-vX.Y.Z-win-x64.zip) -Property Name, SHA256
  ```

  For a tag built reproducibly, the Python, PowerShell and batch files in the archive are
  copied from the checked-out source unchanged, so a difference in one of those is worth
  an issue.

## Code signing

Nothing this project builds is Authenticode-signed: not the two executables, not the setup
programs, not `Install.cmd` or `Uninstall.cmd`, and not the PowerShell scripts. The bundled Python interpreter - `pythonw.exe`, `python.exe` and its DLLs,
from the python.org embeddable runtime - keeps the signatures it was published with: the
Python Software Foundation's, and Microsoft's on the two Visual C++ runtime DLLs
(`vcruntime140.dll` and `vcruntime140_1.dll`).

- **The process that starts at sign-in is the signed interpreter.** For an installation from
  the release archive with sign-in start on, Windows starts its bundled `pythonw.exe`. The
  Python code it runs is this project's own and is not signed.
- **What is not signed:** the settings window `CodexAutoResumeSettings.exe`, the MCP launcher
  `codex-auto-resume-mcp.exe` that Codex starts for the plugin's tools and panel, the setup
  programs `CodexAutoResume-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe` and `CodexAutoResume-Advanced-Setup-vX.Y.Z.exe`,
  `Install.cmd` and `Uninstall.cmd`, and the
  project's scripts. A `.cmd` file cannot carry an
  Authenticode signature at all.
- From v0.6.0, the two executables carry a version resource, so **Properties → Details**
  shows the product name, the version, and a copyright line naming the author. That ships in
  v0.6.0; the executables in v0.5.0 through v0.5.7 were built without that product
  information. It is text in the file, not a signature: anyone can write it, and Windows'
  security prompts still name the publisher as unknown.

What you may see because of that:

- **SmartScreen, on the manual route.** Extracting a downloaded ZIP with Explorer carries
  the download's mark of the web onto the extracted files, so running `Install.cmd` may
  show *Windows protected your PC* with an unknown publisher. That warning says the file
  is unsigned and not widely seen. It does not say the file failed a check. The digest
  checks above are what tell you it is the published file.
- **SmartScreen, on the setup program.** Running the downloaded setup program may show the same
  *Windows protected your PC*; **More info**, then **Run anyway**, starts it. It is asked about
  alone: what it unpacks carries no mark of the web, so its `Install.cmd` is not asked about again.
- **Smart App Control.** On a PC where it is on, it may block the unsigned programs and
  scripts, and it offers no exception for a single file. The watcher's process is the
  signed interpreter. A block applies to what it hits - for example the setup program, the
  settings window, the plugin's tools and panel, `Install.cmd`, the installer's PowerShell scripts, or the
  C# code that setup compiles through PowerShell to create the Start Menu shortcut. That
  list has not been tested against Smart App Control. This project does not ask you to turn Smart App
  Control off.

If either one blocks you, please open an issue naming the file and the message.

## What is not verified

- **Two other releases carry v0.6.6's archive name.**
  [`v0.6.6-alpha`](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases/tag/v0.6.6-alpha)
  is the candidate v0.6.6 was first cut from, published and then set aside, and
  [`v0.6.6-beta`](https://github.com/songyb111-gachon/codex-auto-resume-windows/releases/tag/v0.6.6-beta)
  is the build first announced as v0.6.6, before the panel had a theme of its own. Both were kept
  rather than deleted, and renaming a tag did not rename the file already attached to it, so each
  archive is also called `CodexAutoResume-v0.6.6-win-x64.zip`. Same name, different bytes,
  different digests. Step 3 compares against the digest pinned for `0.6.6` in
  `scripts/release.json`, which is the release published at the tag `v0.6.6` and neither of those -
  so a download taken from either pre-release's page fails the comparison, which is the comparison
  doing its job. Nothing fetches them: the update check reads the tag out of the URL
  `releases/latest` ends at and accepts `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` alone, and the pre-release it can
  offer from v0.6.11 has to be newer than both the version installed and the newest release, which
  these two never are.

- **The releases are not GitHub immutable releases.** GitHub reports every release from
  v0.5.0 through v0.6.0 as not immutable, v0.6.0 included - the API was asked after it was
  published. Immutability is the repository setting that
  makes GitHub itself refuse to change a published release's files or move its tag.
  The release workflow, from v0.5.4 on, refuses to publish over a version that already
  has assets. Its v0.5.2 and v0.5.3 versions did the opposite: a dispatch given a tag
  rebuilt that tag and replaced the release's assets (`--clobber`), and those copies of
  the workflow remain at those tags. Either way the rule binds the workflow, not everyone
  with write access to the repository, who can replace an asset by hand, or run one of
  those earlier copies from a branch that holds it (dispatched on its own tag, it stops
  when it tries to create a release that already exists). What would reveal a replaced archive is the digest pinned on `main`, and an
  attestation checked against the release workflow and the tag as in step 4, which is why
  the steps above use both.
- **The archives up to v0.5.7 came from the earlier release workflow.** Every archive
  published before v0.6.0 was built by a single job that referred to its actions by
  floating tags rather than pinned commits, and with executables that cannot be reproduced.
  v0.6.0 is the first archive built by the split build-and-publish workflow, with every
  action pinned to a full commit, and the first whose executables a rebuild of the tag can
  match. That is one release, not a record: the rest of this page is about what a reader
  can check for themselves, and for v0.5.0 through v0.5.7 the answer is still the digest,
  the release page and - from v0.5.4 - the attestation.
- **Tags are not signed.** Cloning `vX.Y.Z` trusts that the tag still points where it
  did. For an archive published by a tag push, the attestation records the commit that
  was built, which is why the rebuild prints `git rev-parse HEAD`. The earlier single-job
  workflow, which built every archive from v0.5.0 through v0.5.7, could also publish from
  a manual run on the tag that built another ref whose `plugin.json` declared that
  version; the attestation records which event started the run.
- **A new release has no pin for a while.** The pin is committed after publication. Until
  then, and in a plugin copy fetched before it, the plugin route falls back to the
  published `.sha256` and says so. The plugin copy an install registers carries the
  archive's `release.json`, which cannot hold its own version's digest, so a later
  `-Force` run through it falls back to the `.sha256` and an `-ArchivePath` run compares
  against nothing, even once `main` has the pin; each says so.
- **Reproducibility across machines**, as described above, and no release from v0.5.0
  through v0.5.7 can be rebuilt to its published bytes.
- **`Install.cmd` does not check the archive**, and **the plugin route does not check the
  attestation.**
- **Archives before v0.5.4 have no attestation.**
- **Advanced archives are pinned from v0.6.11 on.** The `advanced` table's `sha256` in
  `scripts/release.json` starts with v0.6.11, the first release that publishes the advanced edition.
  The four pre-releases that carried it before, v0.6.11-alpha, v0.6.11-beta, v0.6.11-beta.2 and
  v0.6.11-beta.3, are never pinned: for them an advanced archive has its `.sha256` and the
  attestation, and the plugin route falls back to the `.sha256` and says so.
- **All four proposed action upgrades are in, and two of them nothing can test.**
  Dependabot opened pull requests raising `actions/checkout` to v7.0.1,
  `actions/setup-python` to v7.0.0, `actions/attest-build-provenance` to v4.2.2, and the
  artifact pair to `upload-artifact` v7.0.1 with `download-artifact` v8.0.1. All four keep
  the full-commit pinning and its version comment, and none is a published security fix.

  They went in after v0.6.0 was published and verified, `checkout` and `setup-python`
  first, in the order the plan below named. Every new digest was resolved from the upstream
  repository's own git ref before being written here, and every digest being replaced was
  re-resolved at the same time, to check that nothing had been quietly retargeted. Each was
  applied as the one line it is: the proposed pull requests also rewrote whole workflow
  files from LF to CRLF, which `.gitattributes` exists to prevent.

  `checkout` and `setup-python` are exercised by `test.yml` on every push, so CI is a real
  check on them, and it passed. The other three are not: `download-artifact` and
  `attest-build-provenance` run only in the publish job, which neither CI nor a
  `workflow_dispatch` enters, and `upload-artifact` runs in a dispatch but its partner does
  not. The first proof of that half is a real tag push.

  What makes that acceptable rather than reckless is where a failure lands. Both steps run
  *before* `gh release create`: an artifact that will not download, or an attestation that
  will not sign, fails the run with nothing published, which is exactly what happened on
  v0.6.0's first tag push for an unrelated reason. Nothing is half-made, the immutability
  gate is never engaged, and the fix is to move the tag - not to burn a version.

  One concern about `attest-build-provenance` v4 was checked and did not survive the
  checking. Upstream describes v4 as a wrapper over `actions/attest`, which sounds like a
  new layer the pin test cannot see. Reading the two `action.yml` files says otherwise: the
  v2.4.0 this replaces is already a composite that calls two inner actions, and v4.2.2
  calls one. Both pin what they call to a full commit. The indirection is not new, and v4
  has less of it.

Verifying tells you the file is the one this project published. It does not tell you the
code is safe; for what the code is allowed to do, and how that is enforced, see
[`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
