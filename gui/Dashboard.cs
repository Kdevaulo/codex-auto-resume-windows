// Codex Auto Resume - the Dashboard: what the watcher is doing, what is waiting and when
// it is next looked at, what happened before, how often it worked, the watcher's health,
// and the settings - in one native window, with no local web server and no browser.
//
// Like the rest of the window it owns nothing: every fact comes from the same control
// layer every other interface uses, over one long-lived bridge process, and every action
// addresses a recovery by its exact interruption id. The countdowns are drawn locally
// from the time the watcher persisted; reaching zero means the watcher looks again, not
// that anything is sent.
//
// Nothing that talks to the bridge runs on the window's own thread. A read can take as
// long as the store and the interpreter take, and a window that stops repainting while it
// waits looks exactly like one that has hung.
//
// C# 5 (the in-box compiler): no string interpolation, no null-conditional operator.
//
// The window is one `partial class SettingsForm`, written across several files since
// v0.6.10-alpha. This one is the Dashboard's own controls, its page frame and its two lists -
// Pending and History - with the column fitting and cell drawing they are measured and painted
// by. Beside it: gui/DashboardPages.cs is what each page is built out of, gui/DashboardCompat.cs
// the compatibility card, gui/DashboardData.cs the clock and the snapshot every page reads,
// gui/DashboardActions.cs what a button does, and gui/DashboardMaintenance.cs the Diagnostics
// actions that run a process. `gui/window.sources` is the list of them all.
