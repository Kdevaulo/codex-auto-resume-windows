        // bridge validates it and checks it still describes the engine on disk, and says why when it cannot be used. It
        // is never the live check, which runs Codex, except after a refresh: the one the refresh button's answer carries,
        // and the one made after an update check's refresh (CheckAfterRefresh). Either stands in for the report until
        // the watcher's own catches up, never longer than a report may be relied on, and not past a report that has
        // since become unusable (LiveStands) - so a watcher that is not running cannot put the data before back on the
        // card beside a note saying it is no longer in force.
        //
        // The refresh is the only thing here that reaches the network, and only when its button is pressed: the bridge
        // runs this installation's own bootstrap, which asks raw.githubusercontent.com for the one document and hands it
        // to the validator. It can take minutes, so it goes over the one-shot bridge from a worker thread - never over
        // the long-lived pipe the page is painted from, which it would hold for all that time. Every answer is said as
        // itself: refreshed, refused (and why), unavailable, incomplete, failed, and busy while an installation or a
        // repair is replacing the files it runs. Check for updates refreshes the data too, and says so here in the same
        // words (CheckForUpdates, CompatibilityLine).
