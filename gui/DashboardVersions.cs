// Codex Auto Resume - Diagnostics' Install another version... (v0.6.12): this repository's versions, in
// either edition, each offered or refused with its reason, and the one a person picks installed in place of
// the one they have.
//
// Nothing here reaches the network. The installed bootstrap does (scripts/bootstrap.ps1 -Versions, -Pick),
// and only when a person asks: the list when the button is pressed, the install when a row is confirmed. The
// dialog is built in its asking state and starts nothing (BuildVersions); only the button's handler starts
// the listing (OpenVersions, StartVersionsListing), so the window audit, which builds every dialog, never
// asks GitHub for anything. What the bootstrap answers is read through two static parsers that refuse the
// whole answer on a word outside their closed sets (VersionsLines, PickLine), and a refused row stays in the
// list, greyed, with its reason, because the bootstrap - not this window - decides what can be installed.
