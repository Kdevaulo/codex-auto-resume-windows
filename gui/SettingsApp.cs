// Codex Auto Resume - standalone Windows settings window.
//
// This exists so the product stays configurable exactly when the thing it recovers is
// not: with Codex closed, the plugin unloaded, the MCP server unavailable or the
// watcher stopped. It talks only to our own local control bridge.
//
// It deliberately owns no configuration of its own. Every read and write goes through
// the same validated Python control layer the command line, the Codex skill and the
// MCP server use, so a value set here is identical to a value set anywhere else. The
// window renders itself from the schema that layer publishes, which is why adding a
// setting there makes it appear here without touching this file.
//
// Layout notes, each of which came from looking at the result rather than the code:
//   * Sizes come from AutoSize containers, never fixed pixels. Above 100% scaling a
//     hardcoded row is shorter than its own text and clips the descenders.
//   * Groups sit in a TableLayoutPanel, not a FlowLayoutPanel: flow hands a child its
//     preferred width, so an AutoSize group collapses to the width of its content.
//   * The Settings page is a list of sections beside one section's cards. Everything on
//     one scrolling page stopped fitting a laptop screen once languages and the
//     Continuation message joined it, and a setting is found faster under the name of
//     what it is for.
//   * Status leads. What the watcher is doing is the reason the window gets opened, so
//     it sits at the top in the largest type here, and the settings follow it.
//   * Every status fact is its own label in its own cell, never one concatenated string.
//     A single label wraps or truncates as the window narrows, and what disappears first
//     is the version - the part people are asked for when reporting a problem.
//   * Colours come from gui/Brand.cs, which is generated from the palette in
//     src/codex_auto_resume/brand.py, through Palette, which holds the theme the window opened
//     in. Do not write a literal colour in this file, nor one of Brand's light fields.
//   * A window speaks one language and draws one theme, both decided as it opens. When either
//     changes - saved here, or anywhere else, or Windows' own app mode under "system" - the
//     window reopens itself where it was (see Reopen), never while somebody has edits unsaved.
//
// Built with the in-box C# compiler against .NET Framework 4.8, which ships on every
// supported Windows, so the release carries no extra runtime for the interface.
//
// The window is one `partial class SettingsForm`, written across several files since
// v0.6.10-alpha. This one is the process and the window as a window: `Program.Main`, the
// `Bridge` it calls the control layer through, and the form's scale, columns, section list,
// header and footer. Beside it: gui/SettingsPage.cs is the Settings page itself - its cards,
// its rows, its editors and Save - gui/WindowJson.cs the JSON reader and the words cache,
// gui/WindowReopen.cs the reopening, and gui/WindowAudit.cs the layout audit the tests run.
// The Dashboard's half is gui/Dashboard.cs and the five files beside it, and
// `gui/window.sources` is the list of them all.
