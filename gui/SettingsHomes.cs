// Codex Auto Resume - the Codex homes watched (v0.6.15-beta): a card of Settings > Advanced, after the limits.
//
// The default Codex home is always watched. Up to three more can be added here and only here - MCP refuses the
// setting by name, and no generated editor draws it - each a folder and an alias of 1 to 32 characters, which
// Pending and History show beside a record of that home when there are several. Like the power action's card it
// is no editor: Add, Rename and Remove write at once through the bridge's `update`, which checks every folder
// against this PC (homes.strict) and answers a refusal in words a person can act on; Save does not change it.
// What the watcher found of each home - watched, another watcher has it, unavailable, the Codex app on another
// home, the same folder as another, being removed - comes with every status read (`codex_homes`).
//
// v0.6.18: a Codex home this PC's Codex uses that is not watched yet is suggested on the card - "Codex also uses
// <folder>. Watch it too?" with Add, which adds it as Add a Codex home... does, and Not now, which sets it aside for
// good - asked of the bridge (`home-suggestion`, homefind.py) each time the card is shown and after each change of
// the homes; never added on its own. A switch under it turns the looking off.
