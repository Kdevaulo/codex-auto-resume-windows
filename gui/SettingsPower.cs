// Codex Auto Resume - the power action after usage-limit recoveries (v0.6.12): the last card of Settings > General.
//
// Once every usage-limit recovery of a batch has ended and nothing else waits or runs in Codex, the watcher may put
// this PC to sleep, hibernate it or shut it down, after a notice with a countdown and a stop button. It is off by
// default and armed here only, once or always (H14); MCP, the icon and a notice can only turn it off.
//
// Arming is an act, not a setting. The card turns it on and off with the switch every other on-or-off setting in the
// window is, but none of its controls is an editor: they are never in `editors`, so Save, EditorValues and the
// unsaved-changes baseline never see them, and a Save cannot arm again a Once that was spent. The switch applies at
// once: the card asks the bridge itself - `power-action` for what Windows offers here, `power-arm` after a
// confirmation whose default is Cancel, `power-disarm` with no question, as Pause asks none - and follows the status
// every read brings (`power_action`, only while its file exists).
