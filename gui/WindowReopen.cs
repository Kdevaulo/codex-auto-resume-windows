// Codex Auto Resume - reopening: what the window is told to come back as.
//
// A window speaks one language and draws one theme in one design. Its words are resolved and its
// colours decided as it opens, into hundreds of controls, and changing any of them in place would
// mean building every page again under a person looking at it. So when the Interface language,
// the theme it draws or (v0.6.10) the design it draws changes, the window closes and opens again
// in the new one, where it was: the same page and Settings section, the same bounds, maximized or not.
//
// It notices a change in three ways: a Save here; the settings changing anywhere else while it
// is open - the panel in Codex, Codex itself through MCP, another window - which it finds by
// looking at the settings file every two seconds and reading the settings through the bridge
// when it moved (WatchSettings); and, while the Theme is "system", Windows' app mode or High
// Contrast changing (WM_SETTINGCHANGE). It never reopens under unsaved edits: then a note in
// the save card says it will, and it does as soon as they are saved or put back. Nor while
// minimized, while an action is on its way, or under a dialog - it waits for those.
//
// The new window is a new process, started before this one closes. The window has no
// single-instance rule of its own - the notification-area icon and the Start menu start one
// each time - so nothing refuses it, and this one stays until the new one is on screen. Its
// command line carries only checked values (ParseArguments), and a window it opens never
// reopens again for what it reads as it opens more than once in a row (ReopenDecision), so a
// disagreement between what it was started with and what it reads cannot become a loop. If the
// new process ends before it shows anything, this window stays and goes on as it was, and does
// not try again for that language and theme (FinishReopen).
//
// It opens where this one was: by the frame one sees, not the bounds, which reach past it by the
// resize border Windows keeps invisible (InvisibleFrame) - a window snapped or flush against an
// edge came back that border's width in from the edge. And the keyboard is where it was: on Save,
// after a save (FocusName).
