    Turn a Codex plugin into a working installation.

    The Codex plugin is a source tree: skills, Python and a manifest. It is what a user
    gets from `codex plugin add`, and on its own it cannot recover anything, because the
    parts that do the work are a bundled Python runtime, a settings window and an MCP
    launcher - a runtime and two compiled binaries that have no business in a source
    repository. Codex has no install hook to put them there either; the plugin system
    offers skills, MCP servers, hosted app connectors and lifecycle hooks, and not one
    of them runs a command when a plugin is installed.

    So the plugin fetches its own release and installs it. That is a download and an
    execution, which means the interesting part of this script is what it refuses.

    What it will fetch
      * Exactly one URL shape, built from constants in scripts/release.json and a
        version this script chose. An ordinary run fetches the version in the plugin's
        own manifest and nothing else. -Update fetches the version it read out of a
        redirect under this exact repository, as three integers. -Version fetches a
        pre-release the update check would offer, which is how a person's yes to that offer
        reaches it, and what was typed never reaches the URL as typed: only a pre-release in
        this product's own grammar is accepted, and it is rebuilt from its integers and one of
        two words. -Pick fetches a version the list of releases offers, rebuilt the same way.
      * Over HTTPS, with TLS 1.2 at minimum, from github.com - and the final response
        URI has to be one of the three hosts in $AllowedHosts below, because a release
        download redirects to GitHub's object storage and nowhere else. The archive and
        its checksum hold every address they are redirected to to the same rule before it
        is asked, and their answer before a byte of it is written (Open-Download).

    What it verifies, before anything is executed
      * SHA-256. Against the digest pinned in scripts/release.json when there is one,
        and otherwise against the .sha256 published beside the archive. The pinned case
        is the strong one; the sidecar case is trust-on-first-use over TLS to GitHub.
        There is a third case, and it is the reason this paragraph is longer than it
        looks like it should be: a file handed to -ArchivePath has no sidecar to fetch,
        so with no pinned digest for that version nothing is compared at all and only
        the contents checks below stand behind it. This script prints which of the
        three it did rather than letting a reader assume the strongest one.
      * That the archive is a coherent build of this exact product and version: the
        files the release is defined to contain are all present, and the manifest
        inside it declares the same version as the plugin doing the fetching.
      * That no entry escapes the extraction directory.
      A failure at any point deletes what was downloaded and stops. Nothing is executed
      from an archive that did not pass.

    What it never does
      No administrator rights, no change to any Windows security setting, no execution
      policy change beyond this one process, nothing piped from the network into a
      shell, and no code from the archive is run before the archive has been verified.

    Asking whether there is a newer release
      -CheckOnly asks and answers. -Update asks, and installs the answer when it is
      newer. Neither happens unless a person asks for it: nothing here polls, and a
      watcher nobody has asked makes no request to github.com at all.

      The question is answered without parsing anything github.com sends. The request
      is a HEAD to the releases/latest URL in scripts/release.json, so no body is
      transferred, and the answer is read out of the URL the request ended at: the path
      has to begin with the exact owner and repository this product is published from,
      and what follows has to be a tag named vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. The version is rebuilt
      from those three integers, so the only thing that crosses from the network into a
      download URL is arithmetic.

      An update is refused unless it is strictly newer, compared as numbers and never as
      text. A local build ahead of everything published is reported as that and left
      alone. Everything an ordinary install verifies - the checksum, the contents, the
      version inside the archive - is verified for an update too, and it goes through the
      same installer, which keeps the state and the decisions already on the machine.

    Offering a pre-release
      releases/latest never names a pre-release, so -CheckOnly asks one more question once
      github.com has answered the first: one GET to GitHub's list of this repository's
      releases (`releases` in scripts/release.json, api.github.com, unauthenticated, the
      ten newest). It looks for the newest one that is published, not a draft, marked a
      pre-release, tagged vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH-alpha or -beta with a stage's number, and
      newer than both the installed version and the newest release. It says so on a line
      of its own, `prerelease: v<version>`, and nothing else in the answer changes: a list
      that cannot be read, is too large or is malformed offers nothing, and the `update:`
      line and the exit code are the ones the first question gave. A redirect is not
      followed, so this request goes to api.github.com and nowhere else.

      Nothing installs a pre-release unless a person says yes to it: the settings window
      asks, and its yes runs -Version with the version offered. -Version asks both questions
      again first, because a release may have been published while the question was open, and
      installs only what the check would still offer: a pre-release the list names as
      published, newer than what is installed and newer than the newest release, over an
      installation, in its edition and keeping its state. A release newer than it is answered
      as the check answers it, `update: available`, and nothing is downloaded. A pre-release
      is never pinned, so it is verified against the .sha256 published beside it.

      Both of the check's later requests - this list and the compatibility data - are given a
      deadline of wall-clock time, not only -TimeoutSec: under Windows PowerShell 5.1 that
      bounds the wait for a response to begin, and a body that arrives slowly is read for as
      long as it keeps coming (Invoke-BoundedWebRequest).

    Listing the versions a person may pick
      -Versions is what the Dashboard's Install another version... asks when a person presses it,
      and at no other time. It reads the same list of this repository's releases through the one
      other address api.github.com is allowed for (`release_pages` in scripts/release.json): the
      same host and path, one page of thirty at a time, at most five pages, whose page number is
      the one thing put into it. Each page is checked as the update check's page is (Read-ReleasesPage),
      and a page that cannot be read, or a fifth as full as the rest, lists nothing at all:
      `versions: unavailable`, exit 12. It downloads nothing, installs nothing and does not refresh
      the compatibility data.

      -Pick installs one row of it, the version and edition a person confirmed, and asks for the
      list again first: a row no longer offered as it was shown installs nothing (`pick: refused
      changed`). -Force comes exactly with an older row or one of the other edition and is refused
      with any other. The archive is fetched, checked and unpacked as every install's is; only then,
      under the install lock, is the state converted for a version on schema 3 - the installed
      version's own downgrade-state, which asks the watcher to stop and waits for it a minute, and
      never kills it - and only then does the archive's installer run. Each answer is a `pick:` line.

      Each version, in each edition, is offered or refused with its reason on a line of its own:
      nothing older than v0.6.2, no archive or no checksum to check it by, an edition change to an
      installer older than editions, a policy an administrator set that the version would stop
      applying (the policy key is read, never written), and - while I12 says so - a pre-release the
      update check would not offer. The list's versions are rebuilt from their integers like every
      other version here (Get-ChosenVersion), and only the names of the assets are read.

    Which edition it installs
      There are two, and an installation is one or the other: the advanced edition is the
      standard one plus one package in app\src. Nothing is stamped anywhere to say which; the
      package being there is the fact, for the product and for this script alike. A run
      installs the edition -Edition names; without it, the edition already installed, so a
      repair or an update never leaves it; with nothing installed, this plugin tree's own -
      the standard edition for a plugin added from GitHub, whose tree has no advanced package.
      The edition only ever chooses between the two constant archive names in release.json.

      Moving between editions is a reinstall, never an update. -Update refuses -Edition. A run
      that would replace one edition with the other needs -Edition and -Force: without -Force
      it downloads nothing and exits 14; with both, it says what the change keeps and changes
      before it fetches anything, and tells the installer the change was asked for. An archive
      of the other edition is refused like an archive of another version.

    Refreshing the Codex compatibility data
      Only on request, at exactly two moments: -Compatibility (the Diagnostics page's
      refresh button), and an update check that reached github.com (-CheckOnly or -Update).
      Nothing here polls, and the watcher never asks.

      One GET to one constant URL with no query string - the registry file on the main
      branch of this repository, at raw.githubusercontent.com and at no other host. Nothing
      about this machine is in the request; in particular the local Codex version is not,
      which is why the whole document is fetched and matched locally. The body lands in a
      temporary file this script deletes, and it is never parsed or run here: it is handed
      to the installation's own Python validator (`controlcli compat-import`), which is the
      only thing that writes it anywhere, and refuses anything malformed, older than what
      is already in force, or meant for a newer product. The data can only ever restrict
      what the watcher does. A refresh that fails leaves everything as it was, and it never
      changes what the update check answers.

      It says so before it asks: the host is named on the output, update check or not, so a
      second address is never contacted silently. And when it rides on an update check it
      gets only what is left of the time the settings window waits for that check
      ($CheckBudgetSeconds below), as a deadline its download cannot overrun however slowly
      the bytes arrive, so it can make the check neither late nor "running" - with too little
      left it is not attempted, and the data already in force still applies.

    Run: powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/bootstrap.ps1
         Add -Force to reinstall a version that is already present.
         Add -ArchivePath <zip> to install a file you already have. It is checked
         against the pinned digest when this version has one; otherwise only the
         contents checks apply, because there is no sidecar to fetch for a local file.
         Add -CheckOnly to ask whether a newer release exists and install nothing.
         Add -Update to install one if there is.
         Add -Version <pre-release> to install the pre-release -CheckOnly offered.
         Add -AskFirst, with -Update or -Version, to stop once the download is verified: the folder of
         its changelog on a `notes:` line, then `ask: install v<version>`, and a line on the input -
         `install` to go on, anything else to install nothing (the Dashboard's update, v0.6.16).
         Add -Compatibility to refresh the Codex compatibility data and nothing else.
         Add -Versions to list the versions the Dashboard may install instead, and install nothing.
         Add -Pick <version> -Edition <edition> to install one of them (with -Force when it is older
         or of the other edition).
         Add -Edition Standard or -Edition Advanced to choose the edition; over the other
         edition, add -Force as well, which is what replacing it takes.

        the wait for a response to begin. The body is read after that for as long as bytes keep
        arriving: a list sent one byte a second kept a -TimeoutSec 5 request going for 29 s, and
        a 300 KB list over a very slow link does the same without anyone meaning it to. The window
        waits a fixed time for -CheckOnly and calls anything slower "running", so a request that
        rides on the check needs a deadline it cannot overrun. The request therefore runs in a

# A copy of this script knows the version words of the day it was published and no later one:
# the published v0.6.10 and v0.6.11-alpha bootstraps knew -alpha and not -beta, took an installed
# 0.6.11-beta for nothing installed, and installed their own older release over it. Those copies
# cannot be changed; this one refuses instead, until -Force says to replace what it cannot read.
# Every copy published before the numbered pre-releases (-beta.2) cannot read those either.
#
# The "newer" case is the one -Update creates and nothing else did: an update leaves the
# machine ahead of the plugin tree it was started from, because Codex's copy of the plugin
# is still whatever version it fetched. Without this, the next ordinary run of this script
# would see a version it does not have and install it - over a newer one, silently. An
# installation is only ever replaced by an older one on purpose, which is what -Force is.
#
# Only an installation of the edition this run installs can be "already installed". The other
# edition at the same version is a different installation, and replacing it is what this run
# was asked to do - so it is never checked over in its place.
