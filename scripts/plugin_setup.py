    copies it moved. `verify-home` cannot gate that, because the first install of all
    happens into a directory that is not ours yet - and never would be, if a check that
    only recognises existing installations were allowed to refuse it.

    So the install-side question is the other half: is there anything of ours here?

    * Provably ours already - an upgrade. Nothing more to decide.
    * Nothing of ours here at all - then there is nothing to destroy, and the directory is
      claimed *now*, before a single file is written. A marker written afterwards would
      authorise the deletions backwards, which is not authorisation.
    * Anything else - a directory that already holds `app`, `runtime`, `config`, `logs` or
      a set-aside copy, with no proof any of it is ours - is refused. That is exactly the
      shape the uninstaller refuses, and installing into it would delete the same files
      the uninstaller declines to touch.

    Claiming first also survives an interrupted install: a run that dies between the claim
    and the first copy leaves a marker in an otherwise untouched directory, so the retry
    is an upgrade rather than a refusal.
