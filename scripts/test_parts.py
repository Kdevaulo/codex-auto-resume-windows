"""Run the test suite in parts - one part, or every part at once - with the result one whole run gives.

The suite took 78 to 103 minutes a lane on GitHub's runners in September 2026, and the ko sync's four
round-robin parts took 9, 18, 18 and 32 minutes of it. This deals the test files into N parts, balanced
by how long each file took in that lane when it was last measured, and runs them. It is the only place the split is
written: CI's lanes (.github/workflows/test.yml), the release's suite (release.yml) and the ko sync
(sync-ko.yml) all run it, and nothing else decides which file goes where.

    python scripts/test_parts.py                          # the whole suite: unittest discover itself
    python scripts/test_parts.py --parallel 8             # the same suite in 8 parts at once
    python scripts/test_parts.py --part 2/8               # only the second of 8 parts
    python scripts/test_parts.py --lane advanced ...      # the advanced edition's lane
    python scripts/test_parts.py --outcomes FILE ...      # every test id's outcome, as JSON
    python scripts/test_parts.py --compare A.json B.json  # two outcome files, test by test
    python scripts/test_parts.py --record-durations ...   # write this run's per-file times
    python scripts/test_parts.py --seconds FILE ...       # the same times, to a file of their own
    python scripts/test_parts.py --merge-seconds DIR      # such files, from CI, into the durations
    python scripts/test_parts.py --refresh-seconds DIR    # the same, when the parts get much shorter or a figure is stale
    python scripts/test_parts.py --list --parts 8         # show how 8 parts are dealt
    python scripts/test_parts.py --check                  # prove the parts are the discovered suite

With neither --part nor --parallel it runs the whole suite as CI always ran it: `python -m unittest
discover -s <suite>` itself (unittest.main, as `-m unittest` calls it), one fresh interpreter for each suite,
recording each test id's outcome as it goes. That is the run the parts are compared with (--compare).

What a part runs is that, restricted to its files: the same file rule (discover's pattern `test*.py` and
its module-name rule), the same loading call - discover itself, once per file - in the same order, the same
runner settings (the warnings filter, verbosity), the same `sys.path[0]` and `sys.argv`, one fresh
interpreter for each suite. `--check` proves the first half: for every suite, the files loaded one by one
are exactly the tests discover finds, in its order, and for every N the parts together are each of them
exactly once. Whether each test's outcome is the same is the tests' own business - a file that leans on
another having run first, or on a name no other process may use - and `--compare` answers it. Parts run at
once on one machine also contend for it - one desktop for the window tests, one processor for the probes'
timeouts and the timing checks - which a runner of its own never does; so `--compare` names the part a
differing test ran in, and holds that part run alone (`--part K/N`) to the whole run on the part's files.

A lane is the suites one CI job runs and how each is run (LANES):

* standard - tests/, with src on the path: the standard edition.
* advanced - tests/ and then advanced/tests/, with src and advanced/src on the path: core with an
  advanced checkout beside it, which must change nothing, and the package's own tests.
* release - tests/ as the standard edition and advanced/tests/ as the advanced one: the two suites the
  release workflow runs before it builds each edition's archive.

Every suite of a part runs, and the part fails after the last if any failed. `--parallel N` starts all N
parts as child processes, each with a temporary directory of its own (TEMP and TMP), and prints one merged
summary with one exit code. Every child gets CREATE_NO_WINDOW and is python.exe, never pythonw.exe: a
console program started by a process with no console opens a window (tests/test_no_console_windows.py).

The durations are tests/data/durations.json: seconds per file - its tests and their class and module
fixtures, from the end of one test to the end of the next - measured on whole runs, in a table for each
lane (`lanes`). One file can take one lane far longer than another: tests/test_neutral_plug.py took
1305 s in the advanced lane, with the advanced package beside core, and 841 s in the standard one; dealt
by one table for every lane, the advanced lane's four parts took 21 to 41 minutes on GitHub's runners.
So a lane deals its files by its own table; a file its table lacks, by the figure for every lane
(`seconds`); a file with neither, round-robin after the measured ones. The same files, count and tables
always give the same deal. `--record-durations` writes the run it ends into its lane's table, keeping
that table's other files and the other lanes'; a file the figures for every lane lack takes this run's
figure there too, so the other lanes deal it by a measurement; a file that is gone is dropped everywhere.

`--seconds FILE` writes the same figures - this run's, as the runner measured them - to a file of their
own, with the lane, the part, the Python and the CI run, and leaves the durations as they are. Every part
.github/workflows/test.yml runs keeps one as an artifact, `seconds-<lane>-<python>-<part>` (and
`seconds-release-main-tree-<part>` for its main-tree job's), so a run's figures come in as

    gh run download <run> -p 'seconds-*' -D <folder>
    python scripts/test_parts.py --merge-seconds <folder>

`--merge-seconds` reads every file it is given, and every `*.json` at any depth under a folder it is
given - `gh run download` leaves a folder for each artifact - and writes them by --record-durations' rules:
each into its lane's table, a file no job timed keeping its figure, the figures for every lane taking one
only for a file they lack (from the lanes in LANES' order), a file that is gone dropped, and only numbers
of seconds kept. Where several jobs timed one file in one lane - a job for each Python - it takes their
median. A file that is not a seconds file of a lane there is refuses the merge, and nothing is written.
They were read from the job logs' timestamps before, which name lines, not files: a test with a docstring
was credited to the file after it.
