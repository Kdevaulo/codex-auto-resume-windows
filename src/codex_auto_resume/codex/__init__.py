"""Codex's own files, read.

`source.py` was 728 lines. It is the same reader, composed here from two mixins, so every
`from .source import LocalSource` and every call reads exactly as it did:

    paths       where Codex keeps its files, and the columns each must have
    schema      finding a database, and refusing one whose schema has moved
    history     every statement this product sends to Codex - and nowhere else
    values      Codex's words and numbers, read one way
    labels      the name a person would recognise, cut to a length
    payload     one interruption, read out of what Codex recorded
    errors      the one refusal

Nothing here writes to Codex. Every connection is opened read-only.
