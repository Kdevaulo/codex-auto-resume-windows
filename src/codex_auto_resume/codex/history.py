"""Everything this product asks of Codex, in one file.

Every statement sent to Codex's own state, history and queue is here, and
`tests/test_codex_schema.py` fails if one appears anywhere else in the package. The reason is
a reader's: somebody wondering what this thing reads of theirs should be able to answer it by
opening one file, and `PRIVACY.md` makes that promise on this file's behalf.

Everything is read-only - the connections are opened `mode=ro`, with `query_only` set - and
nothing here writes to Codex, ever.
