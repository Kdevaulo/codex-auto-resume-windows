    or nothing: no home, neither database, the Restart Manager unavailable or failing, none or
    several candidates holding either - each fails closed, as two candidates always did.

    Either database, never both required: at 02:31 the same day the app server held queue_1

    database alone left the recovery waiting again. The queue is the one `codex queue` writes
    a continuation into and the app server delivers from. A wrong choice cannot send either:
    `loaded()` still takes a conversation as the app's only when its writer lock's one holder
    is this pid and creation time.
