"""A conversation's rollout file, read no further than this product needs (v0.6.16-beta.3).

None of these readings is a statement to a database - codex/history.py keeps every one:

    confined       which file a `threads` row's path names, if it is that conversation's in the sessions folder
    session_meta   the file's first line: who the conversation says it is
    continued_id   the id Codex records the conversation's turns under, where it split them
    earlier        the ids it recorded them under before, by the names of its earlier files
    named_after    the conversations whose file names an id as theirs, by name
    reset_scan     the rate-limit snapshots just before a usage-limit failure, for the reset hint
    superseded_in  whether a person's message came after a failed turn's end, for Rescan and reconcile (issue #39)

The split is Codex's (openai/codex#43422, this project's issue #30): the `threads` row keeps the
conversation's id A, but its current file is named `..._A_B.jsonl` and its turns are projected under B,
which has no row of its own - and a later split names `..._A_C.jsonl` while B's turns stay under B. Its
turns are every id's, in that order (`SPAN`); whether an id is taken is history.py's (`_chain`), with every
guard. Only file names are looked at here, never a file's contents.
