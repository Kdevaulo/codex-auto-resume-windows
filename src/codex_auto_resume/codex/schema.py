"""Finding Codex's databases, and refusing one whose schema has moved.

Codex names its files with a schema generation - `state_5.sqlite`, `thread_history_1.sqlite` -
and an update can bump that number, so a database is found by pattern and then checked against
the columns this product actually reads (`DB_KINDS`). A missing column means the schema moved,
and the answer to that is to refuse rather than to guess.
