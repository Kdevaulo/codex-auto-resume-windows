"""The Codex app's own link to one conversation, and opening it.

A notice about one conversation may offer Open Codex: a click goes to the Codex app, at that conversation, through
the link the app registers with Windows (`codex://threads/<id>`). That link is Codex's, not this product's - it can
only show a conversation, never change one - so this module is the one place that builds it, reads it back and hands
it to Windows. Only a UUID in its canonical text is ever put in a link, and only exactly such a link is ever read.

It was part of `notify.py` until v0.6.18, which re-exports these names, so `notify.codex_thread_uri` and the rest
still read as they always did.
