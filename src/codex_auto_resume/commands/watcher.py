    its nonce names. None can make anything happen that should not - a hostile URI can at
    worst stop something from happening or open a window. The interruption id is validated
    as opaque hex and must match a real record; nothing is looked up by thread, name or
    recency. The page must be one of the window's own pages. The nonce is 16 hex digits and
    stops nothing unless it is the armed batch's; that press goes through the same branch a
    card's does (notifier.activate), and what it says afterwards is raised as a toast.
