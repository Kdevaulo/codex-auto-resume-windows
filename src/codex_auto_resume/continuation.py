"""The one place a continuation message is built.

Every continuation this product sends comes out of `build()`, and so does every preview
of one. That is the whole point of the module: a Preview that renders its own
approximation of the message is a Preview of nothing, and the way that bug reaches a
user is that the two code paths were written on different days.

What the text depends on:

    classified category  x  language  x  style  x  the user's Custom settings

and, where the category actually has it, a small amount of metadata that is already
known and already safe to say out loud.

What it must never depend on, and cannot, because none of it is passed in: the user's
prompt, the assistant's reply, the conversation title, a file path, a Windows account
name, a raw error string, a token. The placeholder whitelist below is the enforcement,
and it is a whitelist rather than a blacklist so that a placeholder invented next year
is refused by default instead of quietly resolving to something.

Style is presentation, never permission. `build()` is called after the engine has
already decided the interruption is recoverable and every gate has passed; it cannot
make an unknown failure recoverable, and it is never asked to build text for one -
`reasons.py` gives a non-recoverable category no continuation keys at all.
