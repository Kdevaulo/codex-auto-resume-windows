        `thread_id` previews it for one conversation (v0.6.11), with that conversation's own
        message - the one stored, or one in `changes` under `custom_message_by_thread`.

        `once_words` (v0.6.15-beta.2, the bridge's alone) are one waiting recovery's words for this time, being
        written: shown after the continuation as the watcher would add them, or reported as a Custom message's
        refusal is and left out.

        `changes` are unsaved edits layered over the stored settings, so a Preview follows
        what somebody is choosing or typing before anything is saved. A Custom message that
        would be refused is reported beside the preview rather than previewed: what the
        preview then shows is what would really be sent, which is the fallback. Previewing
        text that could never be stored would show a message nobody will ever receive.

        The text comes from `continuation.for_settings`, the same function the watcher calls
        when it sends. There is no second rendering of a continuation anywhere.
