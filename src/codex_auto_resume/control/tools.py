"""Diagnostics' own tools (v0.6.11): the logs searched, who may open the state folder, and a demo.

Each only reads, and each is asked only when a person asks for it in the Dashboard - none is an MCP
tool, and none reaches the store, the engine or Codex:

* `search_logs` reads this product's own log - written from a fixed table of messages (logbook.py),
  so it holds reason codes, ids and times and never a prompt, a reply or an error's text - and gives
  back the lines that match, newest last. errors.log, which keeps exception messages unfiltered, is
  not read.
* `state_access` asks Windows who may open the state folder (win/acl.py) and gives back one word.
* `host_app` (v0.6.17) asks Windows whether the watcher and this bridge run inside another app's private
  view - an MSIX app such as the Codex app or Claude desktop - and which (win/kernel.py host_app): a package
  family name at most, never a path.
* `show_demo` asks the watcher's icon to draw one made-up card (win/sync.py DemoEvent) and gives the
  Dashboard the made-up rows it plays (demo.py). Nothing it touches is written anywhere.
