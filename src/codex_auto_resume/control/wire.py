"""The shapes this layer hands every surface, written down as types.

The settings window, the panel in Codex, the popup and the command line all read these replies
by field name, and until v0.6.10-alpha the only statement of what a reply held was the code that
built it and the golden copies in `tests/golden/`. These are that statement as types: what a
Rust port declares as structs, and what `tests/test_wire_types.py` holds to the goldens in both
directions - every key the wire carries is declared here, every key declared here is on the
wire, and every value seen fits its declared type.

Nothing imports this at run time; a reply is still a dict built where it always was. It changes
what can be said about a reply, not what a reply is.

Three things the types keep that a port would be tempted to lose:

  * `bool | None` where a question can go unanswered - whether the watcher is running, whether
    its last tick succeeded. None is "cannot tell", and it is not False.
  * `float` for every time: seconds since the epoch, as the store writes them.
  * Words from the closed vocabularies (`domain/vocabulary.py`) as `str`: a state, a public code,
    a category. The vocabulary is where the allowed words are; the wire carries the word.
