"""A JSON bridge over the shared control layer.

The standalone Windows window drives the product through this, so it re-implements no
validation, defaults or persistence. The MCP server calls the same control layer directly
(mcp/server.py) and borrows only this module's line encoding, its generic refusal and its
reading of a statistics range.

Two ways to call it, one set of commands:

* one command per process - `controlcli <command> [json]` writes exactly one JSON object
  on stdout. The argument may be `-` instead, which reads it from stdin; that is how the
  window's one-shot bridge sends it, so a Custom message never sits on a command line;
* `controlcli serve` - one long-lived process for a window that stays open. Each request
  is one line, `{"id": n, "command": "...", "argument": {...}}`, and each reply is one
  line, `{"id": n, "reply": {...}}`, where `reply` is exactly what the one-shot form
  would have printed. Starting an interpreter per call cost a noticeable pause on every
  click and made a live view impossible; this costs one start.

The surface is deliberately narrow and typed. There is no command that runs an arbitrary
program, writes the registry directly or executes SQL, and every identifier is validated
before it reaches the store. The programs it can start are fixed: the watcher, and - for the
Diagnostics page's compatibility refresh, only when a person presses it - this installation's
own `scripts/bootstrap.ps1 -Compatibility`. The one file it reads by name is a Compatibility
Registry document handed to `compat-import`, which is size-capped, parsed by the hardened
validator and never echoed: the answer is a code.

A command the bridge has none of its own for is put to the edition's plug (P10), in the long-lived
form only: the one-shot form's parser knows the bridge's own commands and nothing else. The
standard edition's plug answers none, so such a command is refused as it always was.

A rejected request always answers `{"ok": false, "error": "...", "error_code": "..."}`:
the English sentence, which the command line prints and a bug report quotes, and beside it
the stable code from `control.ERROR_CODES` that a front end turns into its own language.
Both, because neither is enough on its own - the window takes every other word it shows
from `interface.py` in the machine's language, and used to put this one reason on screen in
English underneath a Korean sentence. Nothing else is ever added to a rejection: no
traceback, no path, no identifier.

The wire is UTF-8, stated rather than inherited. Both callers redirect these streams, and
a redirected stdout on Windows takes the machine's ANSI code page - so on a Korean install
this wrote CP949 while the settings window decoded UTF-8, and every Korean label arrived
as mojibake. It looked like a font problem and was an encoding one. The MCP server has
always said UTF-8 out loud, which is why the Codex panel was correct throughout and the
window was not.

A developer machine can hide this: `PYTHONIOENCODING=utf-8` in the environment makes the
old code work, so the bug reproduces for users and not for whoever is looking for it.
Nothing here may depend on the active code page, the console, the locale or an inherited
variable.
