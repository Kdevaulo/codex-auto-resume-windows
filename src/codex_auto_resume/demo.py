"""Show me what happens (v0.6.11): a recovery played out with made-up words, and nothing sent.

Diagnostics' button asks for it. The Dashboard then shows one made-up task on Pending, counting down
DEMO_SECONDS, and after it one made-up entry in History, and says that nothing was sent; the watcher,
asked through its demo event (win/sync.py), draws one card of the same made-up task, with the words
an interruption's card has and buttons that do nothing (notifier.build_demo).

Everything here is made up and held in memory: an obviously fake conversation and interruption, a
usage limit that "resets" in a minute. This module - the one both sides take the demo from - reads
no state and knows no engine: it imports neither the store nor the engine, and nothing it returns is
ever written anywhere (tests/test_diagnostics_tools.py holds all three). A row it returns carries
`demo: true`, and every surface offers no action on such a row.
