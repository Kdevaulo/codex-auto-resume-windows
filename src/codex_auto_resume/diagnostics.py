"""A diagnostics bundle a person can read before deciding whether to share it.

Built locally and written to a file the user picks; nothing here sends anything. It
holds what is needed to understand a recovery that went wrong - versions, the watcher's
health, settings, every record's state, reason and gates, the content-free journal and
the tail of the logs - and it is redacted before it is written:

* conversation and interruption ids become aliases that are consistent inside one
  bundle, so a timeline can be followed, but that no one can map back to a real id -
  the key is random and discarded with the bundle;
* file-system paths, the Windows user name and anything shaped like an e-mail address
  are replaced.

The logs never contained prompts, replies or tool output. `errors.log` holds exception
tracebacks whose messages are not filtered; they are redacted the same way, and the
bundle says so, so the reader knows to look before sharing.

What the edition's plug adds (P10) is redacted the same way too, word by word. The standard
edition adds nothing, and its bundle is what it always was.
