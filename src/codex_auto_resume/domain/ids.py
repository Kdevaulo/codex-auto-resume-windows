"""Every identifier the product reads or writes, and the one parser for each kind.

Recovery is exact or it does not happen: a continuation goes to the one conversation that was
interrupted, named by its id, never to "the latest" or to one that looks like it. So an id is
read strictly everywhere, and it is read here - the store, the history reader, the Codex
adapter, the control layer, the command line, the MCP server, a notification's button, the log
and the diagnostics bundle all used to carry a pattern or a parser of their own.

The kinds:

* **Codex's UUIDs** - a conversation (`ThreadId`), a turn (`TurnId`), a queued message
  (`QueueId`), the turn a continuation started (`RecoveryTurnId`) - always as canonical text:
  lowercase hex in groups of 8-4-4-4-12, with nothing around it.
* **An interruption** (`InterruptionId`): 64 lowercase hex digits, which `interruption_id`
  makes from the failed turn. A chain of continuations is named by the id of the interruption
  that began it (`ChainOriginId`).
* **The marker** (`Marker`) a continuation carries, `[codex-auto-resume:<16 hex>]` - the first
  16 of the interruption id's 64 digits, from v0.6.11, and the whole id before it: how the engine
  finds its own message in Codex's history, and knows it for its own. Both are read.
* **A client id** (`ClientId`) Codex gives a queued message: 1 to 64 letters, digits and dashes.
  A continuation sent with no marker (the advanced edition's marker-free continuation, v0.6.11)
  is queued under one core makes itself from its interruption id (`continuation_client_id`), and
  that id, which Codex keeps on the message, is what proves it arrived.
* **A watcher session** (`SessionId`), and **a moment** (`Epoch`, seconds since 1970, which
  `machine.epoch` reads).

The readers of one kind do not all accept the same things, and each keeps what it had; where
they differ, the parser takes a parameter, and the difference is written down with it:

* The control layer reads any value as its text - a `uuid.UUID` passes as its canonical text -
  while the command line and everything else take only a `str` (`uuid_problem`, `as_text`).
  Each says why it refuses in its own words, and both tell a UUID merely written another way
  (capitals, braces, a urn, no dashes) from something that is no UUID at all.
* An interruption id handed over by a person or a link has its surrounding white space dropped
  and its capitals lowered first (`read_interruption_id`); everywhere else it is taken exactly.
* The store keeps as the key of a record, of its parent and of its chain anything it has ever
  kept - 1 to 128 letters, digits, `_` and `-` - which is wider than an id `interruption_id`
  makes (`is_interruption_id`, `as_stored`).

Pure: the standard library only, and none of it touches a file, a process or the clock.
