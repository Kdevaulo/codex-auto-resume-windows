"""The plug: the one way an edition's own code reaches core, and what core does with none.

The advanced edition is the standard edition plus one package. Core never imports that
package. It asks a plug, at a fixed list of points, and in the standard edition the plug is
NULL, which answers every question the way core answers it alone. So the standard edition does
not depend on a setting that switches advanced code off - it holds no advanced code to switch -
and an advanced edition with nothing turned on answers exactly as NULL does.

Three rules make an answer safe to take:

* Only core acts. A hook answers; it never sends, claims or starts anything. At a decision
  point it answers DEFER or a member of that point's closed set in ALTERNATIVES, and core
  carries the member out itself, through its one claim, its pre-send look and its launch guard.
* A hook may always restrict, and may relax only as its point's set allows. A relaxation joins
  a set in the commit that teaches core to carry it out, and core holds each to bounds of its
  own a plug cannot widen (failures.admits, ladder.py).
* A hook that fails costs its own answer and nothing else: `consult` puts NULL's answer in its
  place.
* A hook is handed copies. What core reads again after asking - the record it sends, the due
  records it goes on to try, the facts a surface shows - is never the object a hook was given, so
  a hook that changes what it was handed and answers DEFER has changed nothing of core's.

These rules are kept against a plug's mistakes, not against its intent. The plug is the
advanced edition's package - this product's own code, from the same archive - running in core's
process, where closures, frames and the garbage collector reach every object core has and the
state is a file on the same disk. So what is handed over - copies, a view with no writes, a
connection that writes only the plug's own database, a name for the backend - removes the plain
way to a side effect a hook did not mean; no guard here is a sandbox or claims to be.

Core holds a plug only as `Guarded`, which asks every hook through `consult` and checks every
value a hook hands back before core takes it. The engine, the store's claim, the control layer
and every surface hold one; none of them calls a hook of a plug itself.

`edition.py` finds the package and makes a plug of it. This module is pure: the interface and
its version, NULL, the plug of an advanced installation whose package could not be loaded, the
guard core holds a plug in, and the six closed vocabularies they speak in - which are beside it in
domain/plugwords.py (v0.6.16-beta.4), as what core holds of a channel, a route or an errand a plug names is
in domain/plughands.py. Those are `StrEnum`s held to every rule `domain/vocabulary.py`'s are
(tests/test_vocabulary.py), named here as the interface's own words.
