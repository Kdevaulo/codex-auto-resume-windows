"""What core holds of something a plug names: a channel, a route and (v0.6.14) an errand - and which
records of the plug's own core takes to carry out (P2).

A hook answers; it never sends, claims or starts anything (domain/plug.py). Where a point's answer is
something core carries out - a channel the one send is handed to (P5), a route that continues a
conversation the app does not hold (P16), an errand run once a tick (P8) - core holds it as one of
these and calls only its one method, at the moment core chooses and with what core decides. Each is
held to a guard of core's: the launch guard, read under the store's write lock, for a channel and a
route; for an errand, guards it asks core for and enters itself, once each, in which a Pause, Observe
only or quiet hours that committed first refuse the one irrevocable thing it was going to do.

Pure, as the rest of domain/: the standard library only, and nothing read or written here.

    stops the send there. A channel is the plug's code, and nothing made it enter the guard it
    was handed, so this enters the guard for it: consent is read under the store's write lock,

    transport core cannot see into - the lock being the advanced state's too once the claim
    attached it - a Pause, a disarm on another thread and the channel's own write all waited for
    it, and failed past SQLite's ten seconds. A Pause that commits once consent was read finds a
