"""The closed vocabularies: every word the product stores, shows, translates or decides on.

A record's state, its public code, a reason, a gate, a failure category, a refusal, a setting's
choice, what the queue said of a send, a registry state - each is a word from a closed list,
and each list is a contract: the store validates against it, the window and the panel look
words up by it, the catalogs carry a sentence for every member, and a port of the core to
another language has to write exactly these strings. Each list is one `enum.StrEnum` here.

A member *is* its value. `RecordState.QUEUED == "queued"`, it hashes as "queued", so it is
found in a set of plain strings and a plain string is found in a set of members; `json.dumps`
writes "queued" for it as a value and as a key; a database binds it as "queued"; "%s" and
format() write "queued". So a member can go anywhere a plain string went and no byte changes
(tests/test_vocabulary.py asserts each of those for every member). Only repr() tells them
apart, and nothing the product writes uses it.

The module that owned a list keeps it under its old name, made from its enum -
`machine.STATES = frozenset(RecordState)`, `machine.GATES = tuple(GateName)` - so every
`x in STATES` still works, a tuple keeps its order, and a word is added in one place. A few
words are not a list anywhere yet: what a function returns (`SendOutcome`, `LoadedState`, the
watcher's start and stop), the keys of a table (`NoticeKind`), or a list in a module that
cannot take the import yet (`ActivityState`, `IconState`, `RefreshAnswer`). The test holds
each of those to the code that spells it, so the two cannot drift until that code is typed.

A member's name is its value in capitals, with `-` as `_`: `ALREADY_RUNNING` is
"already-running", `NOTLOADED` is Codex's own "notLoaded". The rule is mechanical, so a port
can generate the names.

Pure: nothing here but the enums, and the registry's, which are named here from their own file.
