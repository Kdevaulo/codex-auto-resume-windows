"""Which edition this installation is, and the plug it runs with.

The advanced edition is the standard edition with one more package beside this one, in the
same `src` directory: `app/src` in an installation, the payload's `app/src` in the advanced
archive. Nothing is stamped or configured to say which edition a copy is; this module looks.

It is the one module of the package that spells that package's name, and the one that imports
a module by name at run time (tests/test_edition.py). Everything else in core reaches advanced
code only through the plug `plug()` returns, so the standard edition holds no reference to it at
all - not even one that is switched off.

Where it looks is the point. A package of that name somewhere else on the path is not this
installation's - a checkout's, a copy in site-packages - and does not turn a standard
installation into an advanced one. An advanced installation whose package cannot be taken as it
is - Python would import some other copy, its plug module fails, it was written for another plug
interface, its factory fails - runs exactly as the standard edition does, with a badge that says
"Advanced - not loaded" and one line in the log. It is never half loaded.
