"""The part that decides: what to recover, when, and what became of it.

`engine.py` was 1,083 lines and one class of forty-one methods. It is the same class, composed
here from the mixins beside this file, so `from .engine import Engine` and every call read as
they did:

    options     what it was given, and the policy it was last told
    detect      turning what Codex recorded into records this product owns
    freshness   whether Codex is in a state worth reading
    dispatch    sending one continuation
    delivery    how it is carried, the last look before it goes, and what proves it arrived
    reconcile   what became of a continuation that was sent
    outcome     how the recovered turn ended, and what it costs the budgets
    announce    moving a record, and saying so
    guard       the waits and the two guards of v0.6.11, each asking nothing at the defaults
    relaxed     what the edition's plug may relax (v0.6.14), within core's own bounds
    resend      an uncertain continuation sent once more, where the plug asks and core may (v0.6.14)
    plugrecords records of the edition's own, tried like core's: gates, the one claim, the one send (v0.6.14)
    notices     the needs-you notices of v0.6.11, told once, and off at the defaults

`tick` is here rather than in any of them: one pass of the loop is the whole of what this
package does, and reading it should not mean opening seven files.
