"""Moving a record, and saying so.

One place writes a transition and decides whether it is worth telling somebody about: a
notification is a state a person would want to know they are in, not every step between. The
same place is where a recovery turn is seen to end, so it is where the edition's plug is asked
what follows one (P6), and where it is told of every move the engine writes (P14).

The waits a dispatch ends in are here too: a claim the store refused, a record parked in quiet
hours, and (v0.6.11) the objection window's minutes and the card that says so.
