"""How a continuation is carried, the last look before it goes, and what proves it arrived.

Core has always ended a continuation's words with the record's marker, and proven delivery by
finding that marker in Codex's history (A4). The edition's plug may ask for a continuation with no
marker instead (domain/plug.py, P15): the words go as they are, through the channel it named at
P5, under a client id core derives from the interruption (ids.continuation_client_id), and Codex
keeps that id on the message. `_delivery` takes that answer before the claim and writes the id
into the record; `proof` is what every look at a sent record is made for from then on - that id,
or the marker; and `presend_problem` is the last look, after the claim, made for it.

A conversation the app does not hold is the other way a continuation can be carried (P16). Core
has always waited for the app to open it (A11); the plug may name a route instead, and
`_unloaded` takes it where core would wait, once every gate before that one has passed. The gates
after it are the ones a send passes, and `_resume_unloaded` carries the route out as `dispatch`
carries out a send: the one claim - which the plug's ledger pays for - the pre-send look, and the
route called once inside the launch guard, handed core's own look at whether the app still does
not hold the conversation, for it to ask at the last moment before it changes anything in Codex.
Nothing is queued, so nothing is watched: a route that
did what it was asked leaves the record waiting again with its claim counted (the cooldown, the
day's five and the chain), one that never started gives the claim back, and anything else is an
uncertain submission, never tried again, exactly as a send's is.

The standard edition's plug always defers, so every record it sends carries its marker and is
looked for by it, and one the app does not hold waits for it, exactly as before.
