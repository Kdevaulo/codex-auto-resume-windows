"""How a continuation is carried, the last look before it goes, and what proves it arrived.

Core has always ended a continuation's words with the record's marker, and proven delivery by
finding that marker in Codex's history (A4). The edition's plug may ask for a continuation with no
marker instead (domain/plug.py, P15): the words go as they are, through the channel it named at
P5, under a client id core derives from the interruption (ids.continuation_client_id), and Codex
keeps that id on the message. `_delivery` takes that answer before the claim and writes the id
into the record; `proof` is what every look at a sent record is made for from then on - that id,
or the marker; and `presend_problem` is the last look, after the claim, made for it.

A conversation the app does not hold is the other way a continuation can be carried (P16): engine/routes.py.

The standard edition's plug always defers, so every record it sends carries its marker and is
looked for by it, and one the app does not hold waits for it, exactly as before.
