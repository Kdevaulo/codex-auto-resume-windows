"""Turning what Codex recorded into records this product owns.

Detection registers a failure once, under an id derived from the failure itself, so the same
interruption seen twice is the same record - and a record whose turn is no longer the thread's
latest is superseded rather than recovered.

v0.6.14 (stage 3b): the edition's plug is asked at P17 (domain/plug.py) about a failure core never
recovers alone - and one it does, which it may relax - once that failure has passed every check core
makes of one: its conversation on, not known, its kind not switched off, from the last hour, and not
a task core would stop the moment it was registered. Only an answer core offered is taken
(failures.takes), and only while the plug wants to be asked; otherwise this reads what it read. How
it is asked, and what is carried out of an answer, is engine/relaxed.py's.
