"""Sending one continuation, and everything checked at the last moment.

`attempt` gathers the facts and evaluates the gates, and `dispatch` claims the right to send and
starts the queue process, after `presend_problem` (engine/delivery.py), the look taken after the
claim and before the process - the only moment where giving the claim back is still provably safe.

The edition's plug is asked here at seven points, every one of them after the consent gate: the
schedule (P7) and the gates (P3) once core's own evaluation has passed, where what it can answer is
HOLD - and at known_failure, which is also asked for a record P17 took up whose kind core does not
recover alone (v0.6.14), the words that take it up again, without which it ends unsent
(engine/relaxed.py); what continues a conversation the app does not hold (P16,
engine/delivery.py) where core would wait for it to be opened; the words (P4), what the send is
handed to (P5) and how it is carried and proven (P15, engine/delivery.py) before the claim; and
its ledger (P11) inside the claim. Whatever it answers, the send is still this module's one call,
made after the one claim, the pre-send look (engine/delivery.py) and inside the launch guard, and
a route named at P16 is carried out the same way in its place - and so is an uncertain submission
sent once more, which P7 asked for and engine/resend.py proved may go (v0.6.14) - and a record of
the plug's own it hands over at P2, the words a person wrote, which takes the same one send after a
claim and a look of its own (engine/plugrecords.py, v0.6.14).
