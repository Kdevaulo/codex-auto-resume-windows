"""Whether Codex is in a state worth reading: the app, the usage, the projection.

A projection that has fallen behind its rollout is the one that matters most - reading a turn
from a history that has not caught up is reading a past that is already wrong.

v0.6.11 adds two things that say whether a reading may be trusted at all, both off by default
(power.py): a PC that has just woken, whose last readings of the app and of usage are forgotten -
and, after a sleep longer than Settings allow, whose recoveries that fell due meanwhile wait for a
person - and a PC Windows reports without internet, for which usage is not read.
