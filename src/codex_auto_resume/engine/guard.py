"""The guards and the waits of v0.6.11, as the engine asks them: each reads nothing at the defaults.

When an interruption is detected, `detected_facts` takes what the two guards keep on its record (a
digest of what its task was working with, and its conversation's token count), each only while its
guard is on, and `detection_wait` says how long it waits before its first look: the preset's first
wait as in v0.6.10, or the Custom ladder's step for this attempt at the task, never less than a wait
Codex named, and a little longer with jitter on. A conversation already over the context-cost limit
is held for a person from the start (engine/detect.py); a count only grows with a new turn, and a new
turn supersedes the interruption, so it is judged once.

When the recovery falls due - every gate passed, where it would otherwise be sent now - `_guarded`
takes the task's digest again. Under Hold a change keeps the record for a person, through the store's
`hold_changed`, which holds only a record that still waits unsent and makes what it found the record's
digest in the same transaction - so Let it continue lets it go, and only a further change holds it
again. The claim and the last look before the send see the hold as they see any other (standard A8,
A9). Under Tell the record goes on, and its continuation's notice says the task changed. Neither
guard sends anything, skips a gate or makes anything sooner.
