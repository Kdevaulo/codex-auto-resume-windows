"""Up to four sends waiting for their receipts at once, one in each conversation (v0.6.14-beta.2, P12).

Everything a send decides stays on the tick thread: the gates, the words, the sender, the one claim, the pre-send
look (engine/dispatch.py) - and so does what came of it, settled in claim order. What a worker does is the long,
stateless part between: the bound send it was handed, called with a launch guard on a connection of its own -
SQLite's write lock serialises that guard with every other connection, so a Pause, a Cancel or a conversation
switched off that commits first refuses the launch (I6) - and the wait for its receipt, up to the send's own
timeout. One worker per launch, started at the launch and joined, with its store closed, before the pool's `with`
ends: no thread outlives a tick.

This module calls only the callable it is handed and opens only the store it is handed the opener of. It names no
plug, no log, no announcement, no move and no store but the worker's own, of which it uses the launch guard and
`close` alone (tests/test_structural_invariants.py holds it to that).
