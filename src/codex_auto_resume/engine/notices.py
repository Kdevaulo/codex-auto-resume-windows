"""Needs-you notices (v0.6.11), as the engine raises them: once, and never as a recovery.

A failure this product will not resume (needsyou.KINDS), and a turn that has recorded nothing new for
a time a person chose, are told through the one notification path there is (engine/announce.py) - one
event, NEEDS_YOU - and kept in the notices table so each is told once, restarts included. Nothing
here registers a record, claims one or sends anything, and nothing that decides a send reads what it
keeps. At the defaults it reads nothing and writes nothing: notices are off, and so is the stall.
