"""Records of the edition's own, tried like core's (v0.6.14: P2 carried out).

Once a tick, after core's own due records, the edition's plug hands core the records of its own store
that are due now, and those of them in flight (domain/plug.py, Guarded.records: eight at most, each a
64-hex id, a canonical conversation id, the marker core would give that id, waiting with words or in
flight with none). What a record waiting says is a person's own message, written in the Dashboard for
a time they chose; core checks the words again here (continuation.validate_prompt) and drops a record
whose words fail, so text that is empty, holds a marker or is one of the product's own continuations
is never sent.

Core carries each out as it carries out its own, and nothing of it is the plug's to do:

* waiting: core's gates in A8's order, where one applies to words that are not a continuation -
  consent (recovery on, not only observed, the conversation on, no administrator's DisableAutoResume),
  the schedule (quiet hours; when it is due is the plug's), engine_compatible, single_owner,
  submission_safe (nothing of core's that may be queued in the conversation), identity (the projection
  current), thread_available (the app holds it; never a route, P16), no_newer_user_work (nothing of
  someone else's queued), Wait for an internet connection, and usage. The budgets, the chain and
  known_failure are a recovery's, and this is no recovery: the plug's ledger counts its claims against
  core's, the day's five and the fifteen minutes in one conversation across both stores.
* the send: the one dispatch (engine/dispatch.py), which binds the one sender as it does for every send
  - and a channel the plug names for one of these is never used: it waits instead. The claim is the
  store's own transaction (store/claims.py, reserve_record), which asks again for consent and quiet
  hours, and nothing of core's in flight, and then the plug's ledger; the pre-send look follows; and the
  one send carries the words, a blank line and the marker, inside a launch guard that asks consent and
  the ledger once more (record_guard).
* in flight: its marker found in Codex's history is delivered; none a day after it was sent is unproven,
  and never sent again (A6).

From v0.6.14-beta.2 a record says what its words are (plughands.RecordPurpose): a person's MESSAGE, or a
CONTINUATION in the edition's own catalog words (continuation.validate_continuation). Either goes only to a
person's own desktop conversation - one `LocalSource.latest` reads: not archived, not a subagent's, the
predicate detection uses (A15) - else it waits (identity, not_user_conversation); nothing is ever written
into a child. A CONTINUATION goes only while the turn it follows is still the conversation's latest, final
and with nothing after it; else it is SUPERSEDED, told once and never sent (A17 for it). Both are asked
again in the last look. In flight, a queue item Codex said it took that a person edited is HANDED_OVER -
theirs, never deleted and never unproven - and one a person cancelled, or every one while recovery is
paused or its conversation off, is taken back out of Codex's queue (WITHDRAWN), as core takes its own back
(H4, H6); one Codex will not give back is WITHDRAW_REFUSED, left there and watched, and never sent twice.

Every move is told at P14 (RecordMove), and every wait with its gate and the gate's reason: the plug
keeps its own record, and learns what became of it from core, as it learns of core's own records.
The standard edition's plug hands over none, so none of this runs there.
