"""What became of a continuation that was sent.

The watch loop, the marker that says a message of ours is in Codex's queue, taking one back,
and matching a turn that started to the record that asked for it. This is where a send that
may have happened is settled one way or the other - never guessed at.

What a record is looked for by is its proof (engine/delivery.py): its marker, as it always was -
or, for a continuation the edition's plug had sent with no marker (domain/plug.py, P15), the
client id it was queued under. Every look below is made for that one proof, so a marker-free
continuation is followed, taken back and settled exactly as one with a marker is, and never sent
twice.

        under its own reason: a paused withdrawal can be released back to waiting, and
        an uncertain submission is never sent again, so this one settles as final.

        Observe only (v0.6.11) - the setting, the state's switch, or an administrator's
        ForceObserveOnly - takes it back as a Pause does, under reasons of its own: it makes
        the same promise, that nothing goes to Codex while it is on, and a queued item left
