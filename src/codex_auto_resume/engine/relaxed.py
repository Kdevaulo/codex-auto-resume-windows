"""What the edition's plug may relax (v0.6.14 stage 3b), and the bounds core holds every answer to.

Two gates core keeps, each asked of the plug: P17 (domain/plug.py), whether a failure core never
recovers alone is taken up when it is detected (engine/detect.py); and known_failure, whether such a
record goes on when it falls due (engine/dispatch.py). An answer is taken only if core offered it
(failures.takes, failures.readmits), and is carried out within core's own bounds (ladder.py): what was
taken up waits core's own waits, ends a day on the clock after it was detected, and is claimed only as
a relaxation the plug's ledger pays for (store/ledger.py); a capacity error retried sooner (CAPACITY)
counts against core's capacity bounds, for twelve hours on the clock from its task's first failure.
And P7 (EARLY): a record that waits for a usage limit to reset may be looked at before its time, once a
window, where every wait it meets is its gate vector alone - it keeps its state, reason and next look; from
v0.6.14 so may one a usage read found waiting for usage (waiting_for_usage), as the claim takes it too.
And P7 (SEND_NOW): a waiting record a person asked to send now passes its retry's wait, a postponement,
the spacing between two continuations, the objection window and an attempt budget of the person's own -
never a reset ahead, quiet hours or an administrator's MaxRecoveryAttempts - and every other gate holds,
in the engine and again in the claim. The standard edition's plug is asked nothing here: a record taken
up under another edition ends unsent at its next look, and that is all.
