"""An uncertain continuation sent once more (v0.6.14 stage 3b), where the edition's plug asks and core
proves it may.

Core never sends a continuation again once it may have been delivered (standards 0.2, A6): an
uncertain submission is followed for a day in case it arrives, and otherwise left as uncertain. The
edition's plug may answer RESEND at P7 (domain/plug.py) for one a look of the watch has just found no
trace of - its proof neither in Codex's history nor in its queue - and core carries it out itself,
through its one dispatch, once, only where it proves all of this, and otherwise writes nothing, so
the record stays the uncertain submission the watch goes on following:

* its send's answer was unknown or no receipt came, between 15 minutes and 6 hours ago; Codex was
  never seen holding it in its queue - not moved to `queued`, not found there by any look of this
  watcher's (`_sighted`), and holding no client id of Codex's own; never resent; not cancelled, held
  or carried by a route the plug named (domain/gates.py, resend_candidate);
* consent, the schedule, a compatible engine, the home's lock, nothing else in flight on the
  conversation and the failure still its latest turn - and the plug asked at every gate core passes,
  as a send's are (`_holds`), where HOLD stops it and writes nothing;
* Codex's history current at every look since the send, which a watcher started after it cannot
  say; neither its marker nor its proof in the history or the queue, no later turn and nothing
  queued by anyone; a kind core recovers and has left on, every budget as core computes it, the
  app holding the conversation, the day's five and the spacing, usage, the task-changed guard.

Its words are built again by the same rules, and it carries the same proof: the marker for a send
that had it, the derived client id through a channel for one that had none (engine/delivery.py). Its
claim charges no attempt and no link of the chain - the first paid them - and its vector, with
submission_safe passed as a resend, is what marks it resent for good: a resent record never waits
again (store/records.py, store/claims.py), so nothing rewrites it. Whatever comes of the send - not
started, refused at the last look, unknown - it is an uncertain submission again, never a wait, and
never resent. One that ran and whose proof is then found twice is written so (`watch_resent`), for
the edition to turn off what resent it.

The standard edition's plug never answers RESEND, and nothing here runs for it.
