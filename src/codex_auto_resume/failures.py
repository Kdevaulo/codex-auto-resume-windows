"""Classification of a failed Codex turn into one recovery category.

Everything here is decided from *structured* values that Codex itself writes:
the `codexErrorInfo` variant first, then an HTTP status carried by that variant.
A message is consulted only when there is no structured code at all, and only to
recognise a short list of unambiguous transport failures that have no code.

The rule that matters: an error this module cannot place is `unknown`, and
`unknown` is never retried. Adding a code to the wrong bucket is far worse than
leaving it unclassified, so anything doubtful is left out on purpose.

No error text leaves this module. Callers receive a category name only - and, from v0.6.14, for
the edition's plug (domain/plug.py, P17) the error's shape: Codex's own code, a status number, the
form the error took and whether it had a message, never the message (`shape`). What core would take
up of a failure it never recovers alone is decided here too, by a fence no plug can widen (`admits`).
