"""The Codex homes a watcher is set to watch beside the default one (v0.6.14-beta.2), as Settings keep them.

The default home is what it always was: `--codex-home`, else CODEX_HOME, else %USERPROFILE%\\.codex
(config.codex_home). Up to MAX_EXTRA more are named in the settings' `codex_homes`, each a folder and an
alias of its own - 1 to 32 characters on one line, which Pending, History and the panel show beside a
record of that home when there are several. Written only in the Dashboard (control/policy.py; MCP's
update_settings refuses the field whatever its schema says, mcp/server.py).

A home is keyed by the SHA-256 of its resolved, case-folded path - the name its lock has had since v0.6.0
(win/homelock.py) and the `home_key` its records carry (state schema 5). Its folder's identity, which no
spelling changes (win/folderid.py), is asked by the callers that may do I/O, never here: two configured
homes that are one folder are refused when they are written (`strict`), and a watcher watches one folder
once (runtime/homes.py).

Pure but for `key` (Path.resolve) and `problem`, which look at the folder; the identity is handed in.
