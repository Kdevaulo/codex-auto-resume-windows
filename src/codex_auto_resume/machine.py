"""The recovery state machine: the stored states, the legal moves between them, and
what each one means to a person.

Everything here is a pure function of values that are already in our own store. No
Codex database is read, no settings file is opened and no clock is consulted, so the
answer a user interface shows for a record is the answer every other interface shows
for the same row.

Three layers, kept apart on purpose:

* **Stored states** are the engine's working vocabulary. They are precise about what
  the engine knows - "a send may be in progress", "the turn is running" - and they are
  the only thing the store validates.
* **Public codes** are what a person is told. They are stable, they never depend on a
  setting, and several stored states can share one.
* **Overlays** are facts about the surroundings - recovery is paused, the watcher is
  not running - that change what a waiting record will do next without changing what
  it is. They never apply to a record that may already have been sent.
Since v0.6.10-alpha this is the front, and the three layers above are three files:

    domain/states.py   the stored states and the legal moves between them
    domain/gates.py    what is checked before anything is sent, and the stored vector
    domain/public.py   the public codes and the overlays, as every interface shows them

Which is what "kept apart on purpose" had always said, said in the tree rather than in a
comment: one 416-line module was three of the eight parts `docs/ROADMAP.md` says the Rust core
is built from, and `tests/test_stack.py` is what holds it to being three. Everything is
re-exported here, so nothing that imports `machine` changes.
