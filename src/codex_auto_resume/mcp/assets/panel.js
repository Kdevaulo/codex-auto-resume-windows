// A drop-down: a select, and the list this page opens for it (`.combo` in the stylesheet says why).
//
// The select stays in the page, hidden, and is still the value: EDITORS read it, the page listens
// to its `change`, and picking from the list sets it and fires that `change`, so nothing that reads
// a choice knows the list exists. Nothing can open the browser's own list: the select is never
// shown, never focused and never reached by Tab.
//
// What is seen, focused and read out is a combobox, as the WAI-ARIA pattern for a select-only
// combobox has it: `aria-expanded` while its list is open, `aria-activedescendant` naming the item
// the keyboard is on - focus itself never leaves the combobox - and a listbox of options, the
// current value's `aria-selected`. The listbox is the card; what scrolls inside it says nothing of
// its own. Its keys are the pattern's and the window's list's (SoftCombo) together:
//   closed  Down, Up, Enter, Space, F4, Alt+Down and Alt+Up open the list on the current value;
//           Home and End open it on the first and the last item, Page Up and Page Down a page along;
//           a letter opens it on the next item whose name begins with it;
//   open    Up, Down, Home, End, Page Up and Page Down move - a page is what shows, less one row, as
//           in the window; Enter, Space, F4, Alt+Up and Alt+Down pick and close; Tab picks and moves
//           on; Escape closes and changes nothing; Left and Right do nothing; a letter finds.
// Letters typed within a second of each other are one search, the window's TypeAhead, measured
// between the keys' own time stamps, so nothing here ticks. The search is the window's
// (SoftCombo.Find): a first letter looks from the item after the one the keyboard is on, round to
// the start, and the same letter again steps on through the items it begins; a longer search keeps
// the item the keyboard is on while that still matches, so a word typed through goes to its item and
// stays there.
//
// The pointer: a press on the field opens or closes the list, a press on an item picks it. The
// pointer moving over an item moves the keyboard's item there - shown by the item rising rather than
// by the ring - so Enter takes the item under the pointer, as in the window; a move the browser makes
// up for a pointer that stood still while the list appeared or scrolled under it leaves the keyboard
// where it is. A press anywhere else, the page losing focus - to another window, or to Codex itself -
// and Tab away all close it, since each takes focus from the combobox; only Tab picks on the way. A
// press inside the list keeps focus where it is. The wheel scrolls a long list, a row at a time, and
// stops at its ends rather than carrying on into the page.
// How many rows a list shows before it scrolls, the window's MaxDropDownItems: about ten, the owner's
// number for the language pickers (v0.6.11), whose seventeen choices scroll.
