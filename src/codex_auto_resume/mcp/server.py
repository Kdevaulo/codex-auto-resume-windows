"""An MCP server so the product can be managed from inside Codex.

What this is: a typed front end. Every tool here calls the same validated control layer
the command line, the Codex skill and the settings window call, so a value set from a
Codex conversation is the same value the window shows.

What this is deliberately not:

* **Not a second recovery engine.** No tool detects a failure, schedules an attempt,
  reserves an interruption or sends a continuation. The watcher stays the only thing
  that recovers, and it keeps running when this server is not.
* **Not a second scheduler.** The one tool that mentions timing brings a record's next
  attempt forward; it does not decide whether that attempt happens.
* **Not a second database.** Nothing here writes SQL or reads the state file directly.

This server starts nothing. v0.6.9 measured whether it could start the watcher when Codex starts
it - Codex runs each MCP server in a job object with KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE and no breakaway, and every
watcher started there died with the server seconds later - so `Control.start_for_codex` refuses and
records what the job said. No surface offers the setting it would have read. What a person or a
model asks for with `start_watcher` is started, in that same job, and since v0.6.10 the reply says
it lasts only until Codex ends this server rather than reporting a lasting start.

The safety consequence matters more than the architecture: a model driving these tools
cannot make recovery less careful. It cannot retry an unclassified failure, resolve a
conversation by title, resend an uncertain submission or force a send - not because it
is asked not to, but because no such call exists.

Transport is newline-delimited JSON-RPC on stdin/stdout, which is what MCP's stdio
transport is. Nothing but protocol messages may ever reach stdout: a stray print would
corrupt the stream, so diagnostics go to stderr.

The edition's plug may offer tools of its own after core's (P10, v0.6.11): each is checked as a
declaration before a client sees it (`tools.plugged_tools`), its arguments are checked as core's
are, and a call to it is answered by the plug and by nothing else. The standard edition's plug is
never asked, so its list and its refusals are what they always were.
