"""The notification card, the pure half: what it says, where it goes and how it moves.

Since v0.6.5 a notification can appear as the product's own card beside the notification area
instead of as a Windows toast (`notifier.py` decides which, `notice_presence.py` says when the
card may not). It is the popup's card - the same width, radius, shadow family, padding, type
roles, chip and status light, every one of them read from `brand` and drawn by the popup's own
renderer - laid out like one of the popup's task cards:

    ( light ) Codex Auto Resume                      ( reason )
    +-------------------------------------------------------+
    | The conversation's name                                |
    | Why the card appeared, in the toast's own sentence     |
    | project  -  Conversation: <the exact id>               |
    +-------------------------------------------------------+
    [ Don't resume ]                        [ Open Dashboard ]

It shows the toast's three lines and nothing else, and the toast's buttons (for a detected
interruption; every other notice has none, as its toast has none).

**The moment it appears** is part of the design (requirement 6): it rises out of the corner the
notification area is in, fading in and growing from 98% to full size while its shadow deepens,
on the brand's one curve (`brand.ease`, the ease-out every surface moves on), so it settles rather
than lands. It holds for a few seconds - longer if
Windows is set to keep notifications longer - pauses while the pointer is over any card, and
fades out. Up to three stack, the newest nearest the corner; a fourth retires the oldest early,
and so does any card the work area has no room for (a short screen holds two, or one).
With Reduce motion, Windows' animation setting, battery saver or High Contrast it appears and
disappears in place, with no movement and no fade at either end (B-D10).

**Over the wallpaper.** The popup draws its own canvas behind its card, so its neumorphic light
(a white glow up and left) has something to be lighter than. A card floating over somebody's
wallpaper has no canvas: a white glow on a dark photo is a halo, and light's pale blue-grey drop
is a *lighter* smudge on a dark desktop. So the floating card keeps the recipe's geometry and
drops only, drawn in the one near-black shadow token, at the strength that darkens a white ground
as much as the recipe's drop does (`float_shadows`). Dark's recipe is already near-black and is
kept as it is. The card itself, its hairline and dark's inner top light are the popup's.

Everything here is pure and tested on any platform; `notice_window.py` is the Win32 half.
