"""One notification, built once, shown one way: the product's card or today's Windows toast.

v0.6.5 adds a second way to *show* a notification the watcher already raises - the product's
own card beside the notification area (`notice_card.py`, `notice_window.py`). It changes no
wording, no privacy claim, no notification policy and nothing about recovery. This module is
the half that runs off the icon's thread:

    build(event, detail, identity)  the one builder: an engine event -> a Notice
    deliver(notice, ...)            hand it to the card, or raise today's toast
    complete(notice, shown)         how a notice the card took ends: its silent history copy
                                    once the card was seen, else today's toast after all
    Inbox                           hands a Notice from any thread to the icon's thread
    activate(uri, ...)              a card button, done in process: cancel one, open a page, or
                                    (v0.6.12) stop the power action for one batch

**One builder, one set of words.** A `Notice` carries the toast's own content - the exact
arguments `notify.show` has always been given, built by `notify.*_content` - and the card's
view of the same lines. The card's buttons *are* the toast's buttons, as data: (label, URI)
pairs, so "the card offers exactly what the toast offers" is an equality, not a promise. The
card shows the toast's three lines and nothing else, plus the product's name, a status light
and - for a detected interruption - the reason's label, which is a catalog word.

**Exactly one route.** `deliver` either hands the notice to the card, or raises today's toast
exactly as before. The card is chosen only when `notice_presence.card_allowed` says so and the
icon's thread accepted the notice; anything else - the setting off, no icon, Do not disturb,
this app's notifications switched off in Windows, full screen, a locked or remote session, a
screen reader, an icon thread that did not answer - is the toast, byte for byte.

A notice the card took is then ended by its host exactly once, through `complete`: when the
card has been on screen whole, the same toast is raised silently (`SuppressPopup`, no sound: it
goes straight to Windows' notification center, so the history is the same either way); when the
card could not be drawn, or its host went away before it was seen, today's toast is raised
instead. The history copy waits for the card on purpose - raised any earlier, a card that then
failed would leave two copies in the notification center, or none on the screen.

**Nothing here can recover anything.** A card button reaches `activate`, which does in process
what `cli.cmd_activate` does for a toast button: the URI is parsed by the same two parsers, a
page must be one of the window's own, and the only change it can make is to *cancel* one exact
interruption through the control layer, with the actor the toast has always used ("toast") - or, since
v0.6.12, to stop the power action for the one batch its nonce names, which only keeps this PC on.
