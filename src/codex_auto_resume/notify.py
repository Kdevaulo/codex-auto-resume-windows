"""Optional Windows toast shown when an interruption is recorded.

This is the only moment a control can be offered at the time it matters: the watcher
is running when the interruption is detected, whereas the Codex turn has already failed
by then, so nothing can be added to the app's own usage-limit notice.

The toast carries one button that opts this conversation out. Doing nothing resumes,
which is the default. Delivery is best effort: a notification that cannot be shown must
never change whether a resume happens.

Nothing about the interrupted work is disclosed. The toast contains only a shortened
conversation id and a local time - never prompt text, error text or account data.

Since v0.6.5 every toast's content is built by a pure function (`*_content`), so the same
lines can also be drawn as the product's own notification card (`notifier.py`,
`notice_card.py`). When the card is shown the toast is still raised, `silent=True`, so
Windows keeps it in its notification center for history, without a banner or a sound.
