"""The composition root: everything the product is wired out of, built once and handed round.

The log, the settings, the state, the Codex reader, the Windows backend, the engine, the icon
and the notifications are all opened here and only here, so a caller is handed what it uses
instead of reaching for it. What the watcher then does with them is `runtime/loop.py`, mixed
into this class.

So is the edition's plug: looked for once, and handed to the engine, the icon's control layer
and a card's button alike, so everything one watcher does is asked of the same plug.
