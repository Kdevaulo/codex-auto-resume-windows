"""What the watcher does every few seconds, and how long it waits before doing it again.

One tick reads what Codex recorded, registers what is new, sends what is due and reconciles
what was sent. The interval moves between `MIN_POLL` and `MAX_POLL` with how much there is to
do, and the wake event cuts the wait short when somebody presses Retry now.

A mixin rather than a module of functions, because a tick is the `App` it runs inside: the
store it opened, the backend it resolved, the settings it last read. `runtime/app.py` is what
this is mixed into, and is everything the loop is given rather than everything it does.
