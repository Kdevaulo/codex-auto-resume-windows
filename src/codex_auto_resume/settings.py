"""The one authoritative definition of configurable policy.

Every front end - the command line, the Codex skill, the MCP server and the standalone
Windows settings window - reads and writes through this module. There is exactly one
schema, one set of defaults, one validator, one persistence path and one migration, so
a value set in any interface is the same value everywhere.

Two rules shape what may live here:

* Only *policy* is configurable. Safety properties are not settings. There is no field
  that can retry an unknown failure, resolve a thread by title, skip revalidation or
  resend an uncertain submission - those are invariants of the engine, not preferences.
* An invalid or unknown value is never fatal and never silently widens behaviour. It
  falls back to the default, which is always the conservative choice.
