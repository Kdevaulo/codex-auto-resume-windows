"""Claiming the right to send, and letting it go again.

A claim is the only way into `submitting`, and it re-checks every store-side gate inside the
transaction that grants it - because the engine's view was taken a moment earlier. The order
the refusals come in is the sentence a person reads when they ask why a recovery is waiting.

The edition's plug has one point in here, its claim ledger (P11): asked last, inside the same
transaction, it can refuse a claim every check of core's has granted, and nothing else. How it
is asked, and what it may do while it is, is ledger.py's. The standard edition's plug is not
asked at all, so its claim is the one there always was.
