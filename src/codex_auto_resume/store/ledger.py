"""The claim's ledger (P11): the edition's plug asked inside a claim, and what it may do there.

A claim (claims.py) asks the plug's ledger last, once every check of core's has granted it, on
the claim's own connection and inside its transaction - so what the ledger counts is counted
under the same lock as core's rows. Here is how it is asked: under a savepoint that takes back
whatever it wrote if it holds the claim, through a handle that can `execute` and nothing else,
and under an authorizer that keeps core's schemas and the claim's transaction out of its reach.
The standard edition's plug is never asked, so none of this runs there. Nor do the claims only a
plug's answer leads to, which are here for that reason: the checks of a relaxation, and (v0.6.14) the
claim of an uncertain submission sent once more (`_resend_claim`).
