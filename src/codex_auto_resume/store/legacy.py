"""The state as an older release wrote it, opened without changing its schema.

A watcher from before this schema may still be running, and what it owns is read here rather
than upgraded: an upgrade under a running older watcher would rewrite rows it is writing. That
watcher can be a v0.5 one (schema 1 or 2), a v0.6.0 to v0.6.10 one (schema 3) or a v0.6.11 to
v0.6.15 one (schema 4).
