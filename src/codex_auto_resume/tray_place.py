"""Where Windows keeps the notification-area icon, and whether the machine is saving power.

The two questions `tray.py` asks Windows before it moves the icon that are about neither the
icon's own drawing nor this product's settings, and the reading they take:

  * where Windows keeps the icon. Rule 2 of v0.6.5's motion holds the icon still in the overflow
    flyout, where nobody would see it move and every frame still costs explorer.exe the work of
    drawing it. The shell cannot be asked: on Windows 11 (build 26200) `Shell_NotifyIconGetRect`
    gives an icon in the flyout the overflow button's own rectangle rather than nothing, so the
    rectangle said the icon was on the taskbar and it moved unseen. Windows' own settings for the
    icon say it instead (`IconPlacement`);
  * whether Windows' battery saver is on, which holds every surface's motion still.

Everything here reads: nothing writes a registry value or changes a Windows setting, and nothing
it reads is stored or sent (PRIVACY.md, "Notifications"). Off Windows every answer is the one that
changes nothing.
