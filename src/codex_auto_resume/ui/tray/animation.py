Built off the icon's thread, because composing sixteen-pixel frames costs more than a tick
has and every frame after that is a table lookup. This is also where the icon asks whether it
may move at all - battery saver, the overflow flyout, a locked session - which is why those
questions are imported here and nowhere else in the package.
