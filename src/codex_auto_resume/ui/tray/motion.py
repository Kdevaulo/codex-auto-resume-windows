"""What the icon does while it is watched: the states it moves in, and every frame of them.

The arithmetic and the pixels both, because the documentation's picture builder treats them
as one thing - `build/make_screenshots.py` hashes this group by name to decide whether the
icon's GIF has to be drawn again, and parting the table from the composition would part that
key from what it is a key for.

Pure but for one question put to the popup: whether it is asking for attention.

# ------------------------------------------------------------------------ the icon's motion
# The icon does not copy the windows' six-state status light: sixteen pixels across and glanced at, it speaks
# a smaller language, and the distinctions it drops - waiting, checking, monitoring - are ones nobody acts on:
#
#   watching    the watcher runs with recovery on: a loop of five of brand's monitoring breaths (22 s) - three
#               breaths of the head, then a sweep out and back in the last two, at full brightness;
#   recovering  a continuation is being sent or is running in Codex: the head sweeps out and back
#               over and over, at twice the speed, at full brightness and never breathing;
#   idle        paused: the head is grey (brand's `idle` fill) and still;
#   attention   needs a person: amber, breathing in its place on brand's attention rhythm (5.6 s), the slowest
#               breath there is, for as long as it lasts;
#   failed      a failure: the danger colour, sweeping out and back like recovering but twice as quickly - a sweep
#               every 1.98 s - and blinking as it goes, on the red light's own 1.2 s breath, for as long as it lasts:
#               the one state whose head breathes while it travels (the user: "실패시에는 깜빡이면서 움직이면
#               좋겠는데"); watching and recovering keep v0.6.5's rule below. The two keep different time, neither
#               a whole number of the other ("달라야해 / 같으면 안 예뻐"): they meet again only every 39.6 s.
#
# Until v0.6.8 attention and a failure pulsed once and held. The user: "빨간 상태등일 때도 상태등이 움직이게
# 해줘", then "확인필요는 천천히 계속 부드럽게 깜빡이고, 실패는 빠르게 움직이는거도 필요해" - and, asked which,
# that a failure's head moves quickly too, not only its light.
#
# The user, on a first cut that breathed under a turn every thirty seconds: "회전할 땐 안 깜빡이게 해 / 회전하는
# 시간도 깜빡임 시간의 배수에 맞춰서 둘이 안 겹치게", and "시계가 나을거 같아서". So the head never breathes while it
# travels, its slot is a whole number of breaths and both its ends are at full brightness - every hand-over is
# there, with no jump - and it leaves its place clockwise, along the white stroke only, never crossing the gap.
#
# The sweeping mark is the mark's own head running along its own ring - "the ring is the wait, the gap is the
# interruption, the head is the moment it resumes" - so the motion adds no shape and no colour, and breathing is the
# head's brightness: no room for a halo here. The shape and the taskbar handling are as ever, and since v0.6.8 no
# badge sits on top: the head is the only thing that says the state, on the tray as on the taskbar button.
#
# Of brand.GLOW the icon reads three rhythms and nothing else: monitoring_ms (watching's breath, and so every slot
# of its loop and of recovering's and a failure's sweeps), attention_ms (attention's breath) and failed_ms (the blink
# a failure's head keeps as it sweeps). Its own numbers are
# ICON_MOTION's, not in brand.GLOW, every key of which is the windows' status light's; the taskbar button reads them from Brand.Mark.
