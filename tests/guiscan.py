"""The scanner every test of the settings window reads its C# through.

`tests/srcscan.py` does this for the Python package, and the reason is the same: a rule about
the window is only as good as the list of files it was looked for in. Until v0.6.10-alpha that
list was written out by hand in seventeen places - the build script, the release measurement,
and fifteen tests that compile the window to look at it - so a file added to the window was a
file added seventeen times, and a test that missed the edit went on compiling a window that
was not the one being shipped, while passing.

`gui/window.sources` is the one list now. This reads it, and reads the files it names.

It also answers the other question those tests ask badly. Twenty test classes take a slice of
a control source or `SettingsApp.cs` by searching for text - a declaration, then the next
declaration - and at least two of them re-aim silently when the text between moves: a slice
that ends at "the next `private void `" widens to the end of the file the day that string
stops appearing, and every assertion inside it goes on passing over the wrong code. `type_body`
and `member_body` below find a block by its braces instead, and raise where they cannot.

Not named `test_guiscan.py`, so discovery does not collect it; `tests/test_guiscan.py` is the
file that holds it to its own rules.
