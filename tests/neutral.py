"""Every codexsim scenario, run twice: once as the standard edition, once with a plug that defers.

A plug that answers DEFER everywhere - and the sender's own backend at P5 - must leave core doing
exactly what NULL leaves it doing: the same rows in the state, the same calls to Codex, in the
same order. That is what makes an advanced installation with nothing turned on the standard
edition, and it is not something reading the code can settle, because the two differ in the one
place core tells them apart: the claim asks a plug's ledger inside its transaction, and NULL's
not at all (store/claims.py). So tests/test_neutral_plug.py runs every scenario in the modules
below as it is written, with NULL, and again with `DeferringPlug`, and compares the two.

Only what the scenario itself does is compared, so what varies from run to run on its own is
held still for both runs alike. The ids a scenario makes up are drawn from one seed for both
runs, and a moment read off the wall clock while the pair ran is written as the one word
WALL_CLOCK wherever it lands: the scenarios keep their own clocks, and a real time in a row is
the test's or the store's reading, never a plug's doing.

The pairs run in worker processes, a few at once, because every scenario runs twice: `run_all`
starts them and hands each the next scenario as it finishes one, and `serve` is what a worker
runs. Not a test module (no `test_` prefix), so discovery does not collect it.

A scenario may put a read of its own in place of the source's (test_engine's test_06 hands back
`latest_failures` twice over, with a function of `since` alone). The keywords a plug's wanting adds
to that read (PLUGGED_KEYWORDS: v0.6.14's P17, engine/detect.py) are kept from such a function when
it takes none of them, so it answers as it was written to - the read the scenario meant, with
nothing for the plug to take up - and is not a TypeError of the scenario's own making.

In the advanced lane each scenario runs a third time, with the advanced package's own plug for
a home of its own where nothing was ever turned on (`real_plug`). The core suite there cannot
show it: core takes the package only from beside itself, so with advanced/src on the path the
suite is still the standard edition, and DeferringPlug is only a stand-in for the real one.

# slow runners (one took two hours for the suite) reached it with 129 scenarios still queued: the
# test failed with "scenarios that never ran" when nothing had hung and nothing was wrong. A limit
# per scenario catches a hang just as surely, whatever the speed of the machine.
# It was ten minutes, and on 2026-09-30 two advanced lanes went past that with one scenario that
# had not hung: test_outcomes' T18 usage chain simulates a week of 15-minute ticks and runs three
# times in the advanced lane. Here it takes 46 seconds alone and 96 with eight workers beside it,
# the slowest of them all, and it ends every time; so the limit is half an hour, far above
# any slow runner's time for it and still a finite wait for a worker that really hangs.
