"""The shape of the state database, on every path that can produce one.

v0.6.10-alpha turns `store.py` into a package. Nothing about the database may move while it
happens: a column dropped from a `CREATE TABLE`, an index that stops being made, a migration
that lands one version short - each of those is a state file somebody already has, which the
next release then cannot read.

So the shape is written down: for a fresh installation, for each upgrade path, and for the
downgrade, every table's columns in order with their types, defaults, null-ness and keys, every
index with the columns it covers, and `PRAGMA user_version`. `tests/test_schema_golden.py`
builds each one again and compares it with the file.

The old versions are built by the store code of real tagged releases - the same way
`tests/test_control_v3.py` does it - so the upgrade paths are the ones people's machines
actually took, not a reconstruction of them.
