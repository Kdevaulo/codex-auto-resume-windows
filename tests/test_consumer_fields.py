"""Every field the window and the panel read from the wire, held to the wire goldens.

The Settings window (`gui/*.cs`) and the Codex panel (the script `mcpui` serves) read the bridge's
and the MCP server's answers by field name, and nothing but the name connects the two sides: the
C# is compiled separately, and the panel's script is a string. A renamed field therefore passes
every Python test that reads it back through the renamed code, and the window draws a blank. So
every name either front end reads is found here, and must be a key of the answer it is read from,
as `tests/golden` records that answer (`tests/wiregolden.py` makes them, from the code as it was
before v0.6.5 moved anything).

How a read is found:

* the window: `Str`, `Get`, `Map`, `Items` or `Number(<receiver>, "<name>")` - the accessors every
  read of a reply goes through - and `<receiver>["<name>"]`, `.TryGetValue("<name>"` and
  `.ContainsKey("<name>"` on a receiver that holds a reply. A receiver is a variable, whose shape
  RECEIVERS says, or a read itself (`Map(view, "data")`), which is followed. A name built at run
  time checks its literal prefix (`"custom_message_" + category`); `c ? "a" : "b"` checks both.
* the panel: `payload.<name>`, `row.<name>`, `DATA.<name>`, `status.<name>`, `view.<name>` and
  `preview.<name>`, followed along a chain (`DATA.status.enabled`), in the served script with its
  strings, comments and regular expressions blanked out. A name that is called (`.forEach(`) or
  read off something that is not an object here (`.length`) is JavaScript's, not the wire's.

Which reply a `reply`, `result` or `payload` is depends on what was asked, so it is narrowed by
the requests the enclosing C# method or top-level script function makes itself - a method that
calls `Call("stop-watcher")` reads `result` from stop-watcher's reply - and is every reply when it
makes none (a helper handed a reply from elsewhere).

A read of a receiver this file does not know fails, and so does a read by a name computed from
nothing literal: each has to be placed on purpose, in RECEIVERS, LOCAL or UNCHECKED. A read whose
name no golden answer carries is drift: it fails unless KNOWN_DRIFT names it with its decision,
and KNOWN_DRIFT may not name one that has gone.

Step 4 gives each wire shape a TypedDict; TYPED then names it, and each read is held to its keys
too.
