"""The control layer is one module and one class, however many files they are written in.

v0.6.10-alpha split `control.py` - 1,083 lines - into `control/`, ten files behind the name
every surface already used. `Control` is composed from eight mixins, the way `Store`, `Engine`
and `Tray` are, so no call site changed.

What every front is held to - it gives every name it gave, no import of it names a module that
is not there, a patch on it must reach something outside it - is in `tests/test_reexports.py`
and `tests/test_names.py`. What is here is this layer's own shape.

The two rules worth reading for what they say rather than what they check:

* **No two mixins define the same method.** That is not an error in Python; it is a silent
  choice made by the order the bases are listed in, and moving a method between files would
  change which one wins.
* **`actions.py` sends nothing.** The layer's whole safety claim is that a person asking for
  something changes a flag, a schedule or a budget, and that the watcher remains the only
  thing that hands anything to Codex. `preview.py` builds the message and does not send it,
  which is why it is its own file and not part of `actions`.
