"""One installation, whichever way you arrive at it.

There are three ways in - a downloaded archive, the Codex plugin, and a repair of an
existing install - and before v0.5.2 the second one produced a different, lesser product:
a watcher pointing at whatever system Python happened to run setup, no settings window,
no panel, and an engine resolved from the plugin cache rather than from the installation.
Two of those could be true at once on the same machine, sharing one database.

These tests pin the convergence rules that removed that:

* the interpreter every registration names is the one the installer deploys;
* the engine the watcher loads is the installed application, not a plugin cache copy;
* setup refuses to build a half-installation and says what to run instead;
* what the bootstrap is allowed to fetch, and what it must check before executing any
  of it.

The bootstrap is PowerShell, so it is checked by reading it. That is worth less than
running it and is not nothing: the properties asserted here - no shell interpolation of
downloaded text, no elevation, verification before execution, and a required-contents
list that matches the one the release workflow enforces - are exactly the ones that go
wrong silently when someone edits the script later.

        Checking it means looking at the versions that shipped, not at the entries that
        happen to be here. An earlier version of this test filtered `release.json` for a
        `null` digest - which could only ever see a placeholder somebody had written, and
        the practice of writing them was removed in the same release. The forgotten pin it
        claimed to catch leaves no entry at all, so nothing was being checked.

        The shipped list is the changelog's own headings, which is the one place a release
        is recorded that cannot be forgotten separately - a release's, that is: a pre-release
        such as `v0.6.6-beta` has an entry too, and is not a version anything pins.
