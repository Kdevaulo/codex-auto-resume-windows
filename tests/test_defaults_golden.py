"""The defaults v0.6.10 shipped, pinned; and every setting added since, as v0.6.10 behaved.

The standard edition's rule from v0.6.11: at its defaults it makes exactly v0.6.10's calls to
Codex and behaves as v0.6.10 did, and a setting added later changes nothing until a person turns
it on. `tests/golden/defaults-v0.6.10.json` is `settings.defaults()` exactly as the tagged v0.6.10
returned it - every name, and every value with its JSON type, so a 6 that became 6.0 or a false
that became 0 fails as surely as a changed number.

A setting added since is named in ADDED with its default and why that default is v0.6.10's
behaviour: off, none, every conversation, automatic, and the like. One that is not named there
fails here, so nobody adds a setting without saying so. One entry says the opposite on purpose:
v0.6.16's notice_click, the owner's deliberate change to what a click on a notice does.

The golden is written from the tag, never by hand:

    py -c "import sys; sys.path[:0] = ['src', 'tests']; import test_defaults_golden as t; t.write()"
