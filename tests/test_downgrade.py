"""Going back to an older release without losing what the state protects (design T36).

An older store refuses a newer schema, which is correct - but the answer to that must never be
"delete the state": the rows are what stop a cancelled, exhausted or possibly sent recovery from
being detected and sent again. `downgrade-state --to 2` rewrites the file so the tagged v0.5.7
code opens it, and from v0.6.11 `--to 3` so the tagged v0.6.10 code does, with every row kept.

Schema 4 holds what v0.6.10 cannot keep. The v0.6.11 marker is 16 hex digits, and v0.6.10's
store refuses to open a state with one and its history reader never looks for one - so every
marker is written back as the whole id, and a continuation that may already have gone out with a
short one is made final, which v0.6.10 never sends again. And nothing is left looser than it was:
observe-only becomes a Pause, a hold or a tier switches its conversation off, a postponement
becomes the schedule.
