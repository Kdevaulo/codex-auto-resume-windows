"""Which edition an installation is, and the plug it runs with.

The advanced edition is the standard edition plus one package, found beside the core package
(src/codex_auto_resume/edition.py) and reached only through the plug interface
(src/codex_auto_resume/domain/plug.py). Four things are held here:

* NULL, the standard edition's plug, answers every point exactly as core would alone, and a
  hook's answer is only ever taken from its point's closed set - and core, which holds a plug
  only as `Guarded`, takes nothing else from one;
* the loader takes the package only from beside core and only as it should be - anything else
  is the standard edition, or an advanced one that says it is not loaded;
* a run of this suite tests the edition it says it does (StandardRunGuard), and CI runs it once
  for each edition (EditionLaneTests);
* core names the package in one place, and nothing the standard build copies names it at all.

The loader's cases run in a child Python on a copy of src/ with the package put beside it
(tests/editions.py), so this process - the standard edition's - never imports it.
