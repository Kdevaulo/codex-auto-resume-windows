"""The advanced window is the standard one with the overlay compiled after it, and the standard
window holds nothing of the points the overlay plugs into.

Core C# declares `partial void` methods on SettingsForm (gui/Dashboard.cs) where the advanced
window joins, and calls them. C# removes a partial method that has no body, calls included, so
the standard executable is meant to be the very file it would be without the declarations and the
calls. That is measured here with the in-box compiler rather than taken from the language's
specification: once on a program small enough to read, and once on the window itself, built by
build/make_gui.ps1 from a copy of its sources and from the same copy with every point cut out.

The advanced window is built from that copy too, with a probe listed on its overlay in place of
the real one's sources (the Advanced features page, which the advanced/tests/test_advanced_page_*.py
modules build and hold): the probe's names and strings are in the advanced executable, none of them are
in the standard one, and build/edition_audit.py's check (d) reads the two the same way.

GUI test module: compiles real executables, so it runs on its own.
