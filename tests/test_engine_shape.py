"""The engine is one class, however many files it is written in.

The same check the store gets (`tests/test_store_shape.py`), for the same reason: composition
is the one way to split a class without touching a call site, and its way to go wrong is two
mixins defining the same method, where which one answers depends on the order they are named
in - which no test would otherwise notice.
