"""The settings window's layout rules, and a measurement that holds the window to them.

Clipped fields taught the first of them. The "Retry timing" drop-down, and in v0.6.3
"Continuation language" and "Preview for", rendered without a bottom border. The cause was
measurement, not drawing:

* `NewRow` sizes a row from its label's cell, and it froze the label's margins from the
  editor's height *before the row had a parent* - so everything was measured in
  `Control.DefaultFont` (Gulim 9pt on a Korean Windows), not in the window's font; and
* the drop-down took its real height only afterwards, when the window's font reached it,
  and its `PreferredSize` answered 33 for a 42-pixel owner-drawn field in any case.

A child window is clipped to its parent, so the part of the field below the row - its bottom
border - was cut: 5 to 10 pixels at every scaling, in every language (measured with the real
sources). v0.5.x had held only because a plain ComboBox and its label happened to grow by
about the same amount when the font arrived; the earlier explanation, that a ComboBox
under-reports its height until it has been shown, was not the mechanism - hidden and shown
measured the same.

The source-shape tests pin the reasoning, which is what a later edit would throw away.
`LayoutAuditTests` builds the real window, never shown, and measures every page in every
language at five scalings, which is what a later edit would break.
