r"""What the window makes of the update check's answer.

The window runs `scripts/bootstrap.ps1` and reads one line of its output. Two things can
go wrong there and neither is visible by reading the C#: the line could be parsed loosely
enough that a different script satisfies it, and the exit code could be trusted on its
own. Both matter, because the answer decides whether a person is shown "up to date" - the
one sentence this feature must never say wrongly.

So the real method is called, through reflection on the real compiled window, against real
child processes: small scripts that print a chosen line and exit with a chosen code. What
is exercised is the shipped parser, including its rule that the code and the line have to
agree before either is believed.
