r"""The window does no layout while a recovery waits and nothing on screen changes (v0.6.14).

With one usage-limit recovery waiting, the window hung: every stack taken while it did not answer was text being
measured inside a layout of a whole page. Three timers handed whole pages a layout for nothing a person could see:

- Every status (each five-second snapshot) wrote the power action card's two lines `Visible = true`. While Settings
  is not the page in front, `Visible` answers false whatever a line was told, so the write took the change branch
  every time and laid out the card and the whole of Settings > General - on a PC where sleep is not offered, or
  once a power action had run, from the first time Settings had been seen.
- History's "Turn on for this conversation" button was written the same way on every snapshot, beside a row whose
  conversation is off.
- The clock wrote the Overview's "Next check in" line every second, and the line sits in an AutoSize card on an
  AutoSize grid, so each second laid out the Overview's grid and page and measured all four cards - hidden behind
  Pending, or in front for the same bounds.

This probe builds the real compiled window off-screen, as tests/test_gui_v069_idle.py does, brings each of those
states about, and counts the Layout events of the controls around them. Nothing of the real installation is read:
the bridge is rooted where nothing is, and nothing is shown or captured. What is drawn is unchanged: a line still
appears, disappears and moves its card exactly as before, and the Overview shown again says the countdown of now.
