r"""Install another version... (v0.6.12): the Diagnostics button, its dialog, and what the window makes of
the bootstrap's -Versions and -Pick answers.

The window fetches nothing. It starts the installed scripts/bootstrap.ps1 when a person presses the button
(the list) and when they confirm a row (the install), and reads its closed lines back. So what is held here:

* the button is last in the Tools card, waits while an action runs and is greyed by DisableUpdateCheck, and
  the header's Start watcher waits too - an install that has stopped the watcher must not be undone by it;
* only the button's handler starts the listing: the dialog is built starting nothing, so the window audit,
  which builds and fills it, never asks GitHub for anything (C4);
* the confirmation is the careful one, -Force goes with exactly an older row or one of the other edition, and
  the version reaches the command line only through the version rule;
* the parsers, compiled and called through reflection as tests/test_gui_update.py calls RunBootstrap, refuse
  the whole answer on any word outside their closed sets, and read the conversion's counts as integers only;
* every English word is the catalog's (the 17 other catalogs follow with the translation).
