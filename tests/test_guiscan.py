"""The scanner every test of the window reads its C# through (`tests/guiscan.py`).

The Python package has `tests/test_srcscan.py` for exactly this reason, and the reason is
that a structural test is only as good as the list of files it was looked for in. The
window's list was written out by hand in seventeen places until v0.6.10-alpha; these hold it
to being one list, to naming files that are there, and to nobody quietly adding a source that
the window compiles and no test reads.

The second half holds the finding, which matters more than it sounds. Twenty test classes take
a slice of a control source or `SettingsApp.cs` by searching for text, and a slice that ends at
"the next `private void `" is a slice that widens to the end of the file the day that string
stops appearing between the two anchors - with every assertion inside it still passing, over
the wrong code. `type_body` and `member_body` find a block by its braces and raise where they
cannot, so the failure is loud.
