"""A purge says it removed the settings and the recovery history only when it did.

-Purge removed config\ and logs\ without asking whether that worked, and always ended "Removed, including settings
and recovery history" - over a log file something still held (the v0.6.18 installer audit, M3). The uninstall tail is
lifted verbatim and run against scratch folders (tests/test_installer_uninstall_sweep.py's harness). Nothing real is
asked or changed.
