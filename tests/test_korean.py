"""The Korean branch is generated, and the Korean documents are current.

`ko` was an independent fork for four releases. It carried its own engine, installer, GUI,
workflows and tests, and it drifted three releases behind while still telling Korean
readers the tool made no network request and that installing meant downloading a release
archive. Nobody chose that; it is what a second copy of a codebase does when a person has
to remember to merge it.

So the branch is generated now, and these are the invariants that keep it honest. They run
on `dev`, against the Korean sources, because that is where the Korean text is written and
reviewed beside the English. `main` is English only - a promotion deletes every `*.ko.md`
(scripts/promote.py) - so there the Korean halves skip, saying where they run, and the English
halves (the mapping, staleness, the roadmap's marks) still hold. `tests/languages.py` says which
of the three branches a checkout is, and refuses a tree that is none of them.

Deliberately not asserted: that a Korean page says the same *sentences* as its English
counterpart. Translations reorganise, and a test that demanded line-for-line agreement
would be satisfied by a bad translation and broken by a good one. What is asserted is the
handful of claims where being out of date would mislead somebody: the network, the install
route, and the guarantees.
