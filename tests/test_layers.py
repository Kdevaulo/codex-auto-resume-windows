A module may import from its own layer or from any layer below it, never from one above.
The rules below are the v0.6.5 target (the modularization plan, section 3.1). Those that
already hold are enforced as they stand. Those that do not hold yet are enforced too, with
the real edges that break them today listed as exceptions - and an exception that no longer
exists fails the test, so the lists only shrink as the split lands.

Every import is read from the source through srcscan, including the ones inside functions:
a lazy import is still an edge, and a cycle through one is still a cycle the day someone
moves it to the top of a file.

A role - the store, Codex's readers, Windows, the UI, the MCP server - is a set of module
names, and a module belongs to it when it is one of them *or lies inside one of them*. So
`store` covers `store/claims.py` the day `store.py` becomes a package, and the packages the
split creates (`codex/`, `win/`, `ui/`, `mcp/`) are in their roles before they exist. Matched
by exact name instead, the engine could import `codex.history` once `source.py` had moved
there, and the edge would drop off the exception list while it still existed.
