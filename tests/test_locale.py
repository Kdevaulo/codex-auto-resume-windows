"""One language decision, and every surface obeying it.

Until v0.5.6 the product spoke two languages at once. The plugin layer resolved a locale
and used it for notifications and setup output; the settings window and the Codex panel
carried their own English literals, so a machine whose Windows is Korean got Korean toasts
and an English settings window. The rule that fixes it is not "translate more strings" -
it is that the decision is made once and handed to everything.

So there are two kinds of test here:

* **The decision.** Korean when, and only when, the *most preferred* UI language is
  Korean. A locale that merely lists Korean after another language is not a request for
  Korean, and nothing infers a language from an IP address, a time zone, a user name or a
  keyboard layout - the tags below are the whole input.
* **The reach.** The same decision arriving at the toast, the setup output, the standalone
  window's bridge and the Codex panel's markup. Asserted by resolving each surface for the
  same environment and comparing, because "they all call the same function" is a property
  that survives exactly until someone adds a fourth surface.
