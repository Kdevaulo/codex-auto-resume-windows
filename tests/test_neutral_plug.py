"""NeutralPlug: an advanced installation with nothing turned on is the standard edition.

Every codexsim scenario is run twice, as it is written: once with NULL, the standard edition's
plug, and once with a plug that is asked at every point and defers at every one of them
(tests/neutral.py). The two runs have to leave the same rows in every store the scenario opened
and make the same calls of Codex, in the same order, and the scenario has to pass both times.
And the scenarios between them have to reach every point the engine asks, or a point nothing
reaches would pass for a neutral one.

Then the comparison is shown to be able to fail: a plug that holds every gate does change what
a scenario leaves behind, and the harness says so.

The comparison runs in SHARES, one module each (tests/test_neutral_plug_1.py to _4): as one test
it took 17 to 25 minutes of one CI part, and scripts/test_parts.py deals whole files. Each share
holds its own scenarios to every rule above; this module holds that the shares together are every
scenario exactly once, and that what was asked of all of them at once - most scenarios build an
engine, every module builds one somewhere, every point is reached - still follows from what each
share is held to.
