"""Where core asks the edition's plug, and what it does with each answer (v0.6.11, P2-P14).

tests/test_edition.py holds the interface - NULL, the closed sets, the guard core holds a plug
in - and tests/test_neutral_plug.py holds that a plug which always defers changes nothing in any
scenario. This holds each point where it stands in core, against the same real store, Codex home
and simulated backend the engine's scenarios use (tests/codexsim.py):

* nothing is asked while recovery is paused, and nothing about a record its conversation's
  switch or a cancel has stopped: the consent gate comes first;
* at the schedule and the gates, a plug is asked only once core's own gate has passed, and
  HOLD keeps the record waiting for one poll and nothing more;
* a failure core never recovers alone is put to it (P17, v0.6.14) only once that failure passed
  every check core makes of one, with what core would carry out; taken up, it is a core record
  of its own kind that known_failure puts to the plug again, and that ends unsent without it;
* its words go out only as a person's Custom message would; a channel it names gets the one
  send, after the one claim and the pre-send look, inside the launch guard;
* a continuation it asks to send with no marker (P15) goes through its channel under the client
  id core derives from the interruption, and is followed, taken back and proven by that id alone
  - and never sent twice, whatever becomes of the plug;
* its ledger is asked inside the claim, can refuse one and never grant one, and what it writes
  there commits with the claim or not at all - and the standard edition's is never asked;
* every move of a record the engine writes is told to it once written, a Pause's too, and
  never to NULL - so it learns what became of a record from core, not from the journal;
* a surface shows what it adds under one key, and nothing when it adds nothing; MCP offers its
  well-declared tools after core's and hands it the calls to them, checked as core's are; the start
  route's refusal and the launcher's exit code are what they were, whatever it answers.
