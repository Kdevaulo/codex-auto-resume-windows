"""Every call a layer makes across its own boundary, named.

The engine is handed a store, a source and a backend, and reaches Codex and the state through
nothing else; the control layer opens a store and calls it. Those calls are the seams the
v0.6.10 split moves code around - `store.py` becomes a package, `source.py` moves into
`codex/`, the engine's own module becomes one too - and a seam nobody has written down is a
seam a move can widen without anybody noticing. A new call from the engine into the store is
not a bug, but it is a decision, and this file is where it is made.

So each crossing is a table of method names, read out of the source rather than out of a test
run: a runtime proxy records only what the tests happen to exercise, while the reader below
sees the call whether or not anything runs it. Adding a name to a table is the whole cost of
adding a call; the test says which name and where.

`tests/test_layers.py` says which module may import which. This says what it may ask of it.
