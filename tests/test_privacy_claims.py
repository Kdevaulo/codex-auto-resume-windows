"""What the documentation is allowed to promise about the network.

Until v0.5.2 this project genuinely made no outbound request, and the documentation said
so in the strongest possible terms - "no network calls of its own", "Nothing leaves your
machine", "Third parties: none", "The tool itself does not contact GitHub". Then v0.5.2
made the Codex plugin the recommended way in, and the plugin installs the product by
downloading its release. Every one of those sentences became false on the same day, in
five files, in two languages, and nothing noticed.

So the rules are checked here rather than remembered. Two kinds:

* The **code property** the promise rests on: the recovery runtime imports no networking
  module, and exactly one shipped file reaches the network. If that ever stops being true
  the documentation is wrong no matter how carefully it is worded, so it is asserted first.
* The **wording**: an absolute claim about the network has to carry its qualifier close
  enough that a reader meets both at once. These are deliberately shape-based - a phrase
  plus a nearby qualifier - rather than exact strings, because an exact-string test would
  fail on a rewrite that is still true and pass on a rewrite that is not.

        """Only meaningful where the checkout has tags; skipped where it does not.

        It exists so the hardcoded list cannot silently fall behind: a maintainer who
        tags a release and forgets this file finds out on their own machine rather than
        in a review.

        The version being released is deliberately excluded. Publishing checks out the
        tag, so at that moment the tag exists while the version is still the *current*
        one rather than a past one - and requiring it in a list of history would fail
        the release of every version, which is how this test first earned its keep.

        So is a tag that is not a release: `v0.6.6-alpha` and `v0.6.6-beta` carry two
        builds of v0.6.6 published before it was finished, each kept under a name of its
        own so `v0.6.6` was free for the next. The changelog is a list of releases, and a
        release is tagged vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH - the same shape `scripts/bootstrap.ps1`
        will accept from the redirect it reads, and nothing else.
