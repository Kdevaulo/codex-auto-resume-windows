"""Which Pythons this project claims to run on, said once and checked everywhere.

The question "which Python versions are supported?" had four answers before this file:
the test workflow's matrix, the release workflow's pinned version, the ko sync's pinned
version, and the prose in README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md. Nothing compared them, so any
one of them could drift and the first evidence would be a user on a version CI never ran.

`scripts/python_support.json` is now the answer, and these tests are what make the copies
of it copies rather than independent opinions. A GitHub matrix cannot read a file, so the
repetition in the workflow is unavoidable; being unable to remove it is not a reason to
leave it unchecked.

The file also keeps three things apart that are easy to conflate - source compatibility,
the runtime a release bundles, and whatever Python a contributor happens to have - and a
couple of tests here exist only to stop the first silently dragging the second along.
