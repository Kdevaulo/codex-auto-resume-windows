"""At the defaults, the standard edition asks of Codex exactly what v0.6.10 asked.

Every scenario that drives the engine (tests/neutral.py, MODULES) and is word for word the one
v0.6.10 was tested with runs twice, in worker processes of its own: once against the tagged
v0.6.10 package, taken out of git by tests/released.py, and once against this checkout. Each run
writes down every call an engine made of its Codex backend - `send`, `usage`, `loaded`,
`delete_queue`, `app_identity` - in order, with its arguments (tests/callrecord.py). The two lists
must be the same, scenario by scenario, and every scenario must pass both times.

The scenarios set only what v0.6.10 had to set, so everything v0.6.11 added is at its default -
which is the claim: at the defaults nothing new asks Codex anything, sends anything or reads usage
at another moment. One difference is expected and is the one the owner asked for: the marker a
continuation carries is the first 16 of its interruption id's 64 hex digits (domain/ids.py). So
v0.6.10's whole-id marker is written as its first 16 digits before the two are compared, and
this checkout's text must carry only the short one - every other character of every message, and
every other argument of every call, is compared as it is.

Where the tag is not in the checkout this is skipped, except on CI, which fetches tags
(tests/released.py). Temporary homes only, and no console window for any worker.
