"""Keep local development environment metadata out of the repository.

Fixtures and documentation examples are written from a developer's machine, and a
machine's own paths and identifiers leak into them very easily: an absolute home
directory pasted into a doc, a conversation UUID copied out of real Codex state, a
process id from a real run. None of that is a credential, and none of it is dangerous
on its own - it is simply someone's environment, published by accident, and it is far
easier to keep out than to remove later.

The rules here are deliberately shape-based rather than a list of known values. A
denylist of real identifiers would have to contain those identifiers, which is exactly
what should not be in the repository; a convention for what a fixture may look like
costs nothing and cannot go stale.

The conventions:

* A home directory in an example is a placeholder - `ExampleUser`, `someone`, `<user>`
  or an environment variable - never a real account name.
* A UUID in a tracked file is obviously synthetic: the project's own fixture family, or
  a repeated-nibble pattern. Real Codex thread ids are UUIDv7 values with a timestamp
  prefix and look nothing like either.
