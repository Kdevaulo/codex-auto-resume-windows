"""The state database has the shape it had, on every path that can produce one.

`store.py` becomes a package in v0.6.10-alpha, and a split that drops a column from a
`CREATE TABLE`, stops making an index or lands a migration one version short does not fail
anywhere else in the suite: the tests write rows through the same code that made the table, so
both sides move together and agree. This file is the outside view - `PRAGMA table_info`,
`PRAGMA index_list`, `PRAGMA user_version` - compared with what is committed.

`tests/schemagolden.py` says how each path is built, and rewrites the file with `--write`.
