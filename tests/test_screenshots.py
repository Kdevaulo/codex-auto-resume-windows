"""The screenshots are generated, and stale ones fail the build.

For four releases the committed screenshots showed v0.5.2 while the manifest said
something newer. Nothing was wrong with the images; there was simply no script that made
them and no test that noticed, so "regenerate the screenshots" was a step in somebody's
head. The repository already guards every other generated artwork this way - `gui/Brand.cs`,
`icon.svg`, the `.ico`, the two logo sizes - and the screenshots were the gap.

What is checked is the *render input*, not the picture. Comparing pixels would fail on a
different display, a font update or a Windows theme, none of which mean the screenshot is
wrong. Reading the version out of a PNG is the other tempting approach and is worse: OCR
turns a hard question into a flaky one, and it would still miss a layout change that moved
a control.

Three kinds of input, and the difference matters:

* The **panel** is hashed by the markup it renders. That cannot fall behind - the version,
  the settings schema, the fields a pending row carries and the palette all reach the HTML
  wherever in the package they live - and editing a comment cannot fire it.
* The **window** is a compiled application, so the files it is compiled from are a list,
  and a list is exactly what went wrong the first time: seven files named, five that change
  the picture missed. It is as short as it can be, and a comment in `SettingsApp.cs` will
  fire this check unnecessarily. That cost is real and it is the smaller one. Everything
  the window shows arrives over the bridge, though, and that half is hashed the way the
  panel is: by what the bridge answers the window (`<bridge envelope:*>`), not by the
  fifteen package files it was until v0.6.5 - so moving code inside the package cannot fire
  it, and a changed word, row, figure, name or status cannot slip past it.
* The **popup** is hashed by the view it draws and by the definitions that draw it, pooled
  by name across its modules and the palette's - and across the definitions they import by
  name from anywhere else, wherever those live - so moving one between modules cannot fire
  it and changing one does.
* The **notification card** is hashed the same way: by what it says, built by the watcher's
  own builder, and by the definitions that draw it - its own modules, wherever v0.6.10-alpha moves
  them, pooled with the popup's renderer and palette, which paint it.

So this fires whenever something the picture is drawn from changed - not, as an earlier
version of this paragraph claimed, exactly when the picture stopped being true.
