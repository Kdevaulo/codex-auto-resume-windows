"""The suite in parts is the suite: scripts/test_parts.py, and the workflows that run it.

The owner asked for the suite to run in parts wherever it runs (2026-09-28), on one condition: the same
result a whole run gives. What is held here:

* DiscoveredSuiteTests - for every suite and every part count a workflow uses, the parts together are
  exactly the tests `unittest discover` finds, each once, and a part loads its files in discover's order.
  Loaded in fresh interpreters: importing every test module into this one would put other files' import
  side effects into whichever part runs this test, which is the kind of sharing the split must not have.
* DealTests - the deal is a partition, the same every time, and balanced by the recorded durations.
* LaneDurationsTests - each lane is dealt by its own seconds, then by the figure for every lane, then
  round-robin; a recorded run writes its own lane; and each lane's parts come out about even.
* SecondsFileTests - --seconds writes a run's seconds to a file of their own and leaves the durations as
  they are; --merge-seconds takes such files, a folder of them as `gh run download` leaves one, into the
  durations exactly as --record-durations takes the same seconds, and refuses what is not one.
* WorkerTests - a real worker on a small suite records each test id's outcome as unittest reports it, and
  the whole run - `unittest discover` itself, the run the parts are compared with - records the same.
* PartTests - every suite of a part runs, and the part fails after the last if any of them failed.
* CompareTests - a part run alone is held to a whole run on its own files, and a difference in parts run
  at once names its part and the run that checks it alone.
* LaneTests - what each lane runs, and with what on the path.
* WorkflowPartsTests - test.yml and release.yml run every part of every lane, and what a lane checks
  once still runs once.
* MainTreeTests - test.yml's main-tree job runs the release's lane on dev's tree with every Korean
  source taken off, as main and the release will hold it.
* WorkflowSecondsTests - every job of test.yml that runs a part keeps that part's seconds as an artifact,
  failed or not, under a name no other job of the run has, with the read access the workflow has.

The comparison of a whole run with a parallel one, test id by test id, is in CONTRIBUTING.md; it takes
as long as the suite, so it is a command rather than a test. It was made on both editions' lanes.
tests/data/durations.json holds each lane's seconds on GitHub's runners; its `about` names the runs they
came from. They were read from CI's job logs, where a test with a docstring was credited to the file after
it; every part CI runs now keeps its own seconds, as the runner measured them, for --merge-seconds.
