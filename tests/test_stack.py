"""Where every module goes when the core is Rust, and what may call what once it is.

`docs/ROADMAP.md` names the stack v0.6.21 is planned to arrive at: the Windows interface in
C# and the core in Rust, in eight parts -

    Watcher · Recovery engine · Classifier / Policy · State machine ·
    Scheduler / Reconciliation · Persistence · Codex adapters · Control / MCP backend

and the rule for getting there is "replace the implementation, not the behavior". That rule is
only keepable if each part's behaviour is in one place first. A module that does two parts' work
has to be read twice, ported twice and kept in step twice, and the second port is where the
behaviour quietly changes.

So this places every module on exactly one item, and holds the placement three ways:

  * `HOMELESS` - items with no package of their own. Every one is a port that would begin by
    gathering code out of several files.
  * `STRADDLING` - packages whose modules are not all one item.
  * `DOUBLE` - single modules that do two items' work, each with what the second half is.

All three only shrink. An entry that no longer holds fails, the same discipline
`tests/test_layers.py` uses for its exceptions, so the lists cannot go stale while the tree
moves under them. And `EDGES` is the crate graph: which item may call which, as the imports
actually run today. A call this file does not allow is a call the Rust side would have to
invent an interface for, found here rather than during the port.

This is not `test_layers.py` a second time. Layers are about direction - nothing may call
upwards - and hold today. Items are about ownership: which binary this code ends up inside.
A module can sit in the right layer and still belong to two items, and `windows.py` did.
