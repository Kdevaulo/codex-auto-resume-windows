"""The store is one class, however many files it is written in.

v0.6.10-alpha split `store.py` into `store/`, and composition is the one way to do that
without changing a single call site - but it brings its own way to go wrong: two mixins
defining the same method, where which one wins depends on the order they are named in.

So the shape is held here. Every method belongs to exactly one mixin, the class has exactly
the methods it had, and everything that could be reached as `store.<name>` before the split
still can.
