"""Safety properties that used to rest on one file's text, asserted over the whole package.

Each of these was true because of where a line sat - `engine.py` held the only call that hands
a message to the backend, `codex/transport.py` the only argv that runs `codex queue`, `commands/base.py` the only
mention of `--last` - and nothing would have noticed a second one appearing in another
module. They are asserted here by qualified name across every tracked file (`srcscan`), so a
function that moves keeps its guarantee, and a second site anywhere fails.

The second half pins the names and paths other programs depend on. Some of those programs
are not in this repository at all: a launcher copied into a user's home by an older release
keeps running after this code is upgraded underneath it.
