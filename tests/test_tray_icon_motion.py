"""The notification-area icon's motion (v0.6.5).

The icon speaks a smaller language than the windows' status light: watching breathes three times and
then sweeps out along the white stroke and back, recovering keeps sweeping, paused is grey and still,
and since v0.6.8 attention is amber and breathes slowly while a failure is red, sweeps twice as quickly
as recovering and blinks as it goes. Everything that decides a frame is a pure function of the
state and a clock, tested here as tables; the frames are pure pixels, pinned by a digest; and the
icon's own timer, its swaps and its HICONs are exercised on Windows against a fake shell, where a
leak would show.

The user's rules for the motion (v0.6.5): "회전할 땐 안 깜빡이게 해 / 회전하는 시간도 깜빡임 시간의 배수에 맞춰서
둘이 안 겹치게" - the head never breathes while it travels, its slot is a whole number of breaths, and
every hand-over between the two is at full brightness; and "시계가 나을거 같아서" - it leaves its place
clockwise. It leaves it along the mark's own white stroke and comes back the same way, never crossing
the gap, so the head is always somewhere the ring is drawn.
