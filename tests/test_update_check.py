r"""What the update check accepts as an answer to "is there a newer release?".

The check is the one place where a version number crosses from the network into a
download URL, so the question is not whether it works but what it refuses. It asks
github.com with HEAD - no body is transferred, so there is nothing to parse - and reads
the answer out of the URL the request ended at. Everything that matters is therefore in
how that URL is judged: a fork, a repository of the same owner with a different name, an
owner whose name merely starts with ours, a tag that is not a version, a host that is
allowed for downloads but does not answer for releases.

Reading the script would show the rules are written. These tests run them. The real
function definitions are lifted out of `scripts/bootstrap.ps1` by the PowerShell parser
and defined in a session where `Invoke-WebRequest` is a stub, so what is exercised is the
shipped code with the network replaced - and no test here reaches the internet.
