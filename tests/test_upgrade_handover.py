"""An upgrade replaces the running watcher, and the launchers run only system binaries.

Both came out of the security review for v0.5.7.

Upgrading used to rename app\\ and runtime\\ under a live watcher - which Windows allows -
and leave the old process running the old code from the renamed copy, while setup saw
the watcher mutex held and started nothing. For an ordinary release that delays the new
version until the next sign-in. For a security fix it means the fix is installed and not
in effect, so "upgrade" would not have been the remedy the changelog says it is. The
installer now asks the watcher to stop through its own stop event and waits for it.

Measured on real Windows with the exact block from install.ps1 run against a staged
installation: a running watcher is handed over in under two seconds; a stand-in that
ignores the request is left running after sixty seconds, never killed, and the installer
says so instead of claiming the new version is running.

Install.cmd and Uninstall.cmd called `chcp` and `powershell.exe` by bare name, and
cmd.exe searches the current directory first. Extracted into a Downloads folder that
already held a planted chcp.bat, the verified installer ran the planted file before its
own script. Reproduced before the fix.
