"""The closed vocabularies: every word the product stores, sends, translates or branches on.

A record's state, a public code, a reason, a gate, a failure category, an error code, a
setting's choice, a registry state - each is a string from a closed list, and each list is
also a contract: the store validates against it, the window and the panel look words up by it,
the catalogs carry a sentence for each member, and the Rust core of v0.6.20 has to write the same
strings. v0.6.5 gives every list one home, `domain/vocabulary.py`, as an `enum.StrEnum`, and
keeps each old constant under its old name so that every `x in STATES` still works.

What this file pins is that none of that changed a word. Each list is held here, as it was
before the move, to its kind, its length and a digest of its members (sorted for a set, in
order for a tuple, item by item for a mapping), so a member added, dropped, renamed or
reordered anywhere fails here whichever module the list lives in. A list that changes on
purpose has its line here changed in the same commit.

Some vocabularies are not a list anywhere: they are the words a function hands back - what
the queue says of a send, what a watcher start or stop came to. Those are read from the
functions themselves, wherever they are.

And every enum is held to the code that spells its words (HOMES), and every member to what
makes a `StrEnum` safe to put where a plain string was (StrEnumTests): it hashes and compares
as its value, and JSON, the database and "%s" write it as its value.
