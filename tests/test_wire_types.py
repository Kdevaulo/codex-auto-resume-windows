"""The typed contracts in `control/wire.py`, held to what the wire actually carries.

A type that says more than the reply is a promise a Rust port would build and nobody would keep,
and a reply that carries more than the type is a field a port would drop. So each contract is
checked against every golden answer that holds its shape (`tests/golden/`), both ways:

  * every key a reply carries is declared, and every declared key is carried by some reply;
  * a key the contract requires is in every reply, not only in some;
  * every value seen fits the declared type - `float` takes a JSON integer, `bool` is not an
    `int`, and None only where the type says `| None`.

`tests/test_consumer_fields.py` holds the other side: every field the window or the panel reads
is a key of the contract its receiver is typed with (its TYPED table).
