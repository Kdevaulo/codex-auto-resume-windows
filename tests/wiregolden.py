"""The wire goldens: what the bridge and the MCP server answer, for every command and every tool.

The Settings window and the Codex panel read the bridge's (`controlcli`) and the MCP server's
(`mcpserver`) answers by field name, and v0.6.5 moves every module those answers are built in.
A field renamed on the way passes every Python test that reads it back through the same renamed
code, and the window, which reads the old name, draws a blank. So the answers are pinned here,
as files, from the code as it was before anything moved:

* `tests/golden/bridge/<command>.json` - one per bridge command (`controlcli.PLAIN` and
  `WITH_ARGUMENT`), each a few requests in order, valid ones and representative bad ones, and
  the reply to each; `_framing.json` holds whole request lines and the reply lines `serve`
  writes for them: malformed lines, ids, commands and arguments, and a line it does not answer.
* `tests/golden/mcp/<tool>.json` - one per MCP tool, `tools-list.json` for the tool list itself,
  and `_protocol.json` for the JSON-RPC envelope around them.

`tests/test_wire_goldens.py` regenerates every file on each run and compares it byte for byte,
and `tests/test_consumer_fields.py` holds the window's and the panel's reads to them.

How they are made. Each file is asked of a fresh scratch installation - the one the screenshot
envelope asks (`build/make_screenshots.py`, `pinned_installation`): the same settings, the same
records written by the product's own store, the same synthetic Codex home, the same clock, pid
and language, and the same registry stand-in that reads "nothing registered" and refuses every
write. Only what the envelope never needs is added here, and all of it is golden-only:

* one more record, a recovery that ran out of attempts, so "give attempts back" has something
  to give back (`_seed_exhausted`);
* no Codex engine to discover: `LOCALAPPDATA` points into the scratch directory, so a live
  compatibility check finds none on every machine instead of running this machine's `codex`.
  The one exception is a case marked `engine=True`, which reads - never checks live - the
  watcher's report the envelope writes for the pictures' Codex (`seed_compatibility`, with its
  stand-in engine that answers two questions and starts nothing). It is there so the reply the
  Dashboard draws Reported's counts from (v0.6.10) is held byte for byte, counts and all;
* no process at all. `subprocess.Popen` refuses (`ProcessRefused`, a BaseException, so the bridge
  cannot turn it into a polite refusal) for the whole run; the two cases that need one get a
  stand-in instead - a watcher launch whose "process" has already exited, and a registry
  refresh whose bootstrap "printed" its one line;
* the Run key as a dictionary for the `startup` command, through `startup`'s own install,
  uninstall and read, so switching start-at-sign-in on and off is answered without a registry;
* the MCP server can reach neither the registry refresh nor the import (`RefreshReached`).

Nothing here starts a watcher or any other process, writes the registry, or reads the user's own
Codex home, installation or engine.

Canonical where needed, and only there. The answers are the wire's text with the four pinned
directories written as `<scratch>`, `<checkout>`, `<temp>` and `<profile>` (as the envelope writes
them) and the product version as `<version>`, so a release is not a wire change. Every reply line
is checked as it was written before it is parsed: one line, ending in `\\n`, exactly what
`json.dumps(reply, ensure_ascii=False)` writes (so UTF-8 as characters, the default separators,
keys in the order the code built them). The files keep that key order; they are indented so a
changed field reads as a one-line diff.

After a deliberate wire change - never to make a red test green - regenerate them from the
repository root and review the diff:

    python -X utf8 tests/wiregolden.py --write

Without `--write` it only checks, prints the files that differ and exits 1 if any does.
